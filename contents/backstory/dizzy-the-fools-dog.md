Dizzy's real name is Discernment of the Higher Good, and is an archetype, too. Dizzy is always there for the Fool, but most of what Dizzy says goes unnoticed.

Dizzy seldom talks, but rather dances his messages, and The Fool can't figure that out. Hence the name Dizzy.

The movie "The Fifth Element" referred to the traditional four elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. In western metaphysical tradition, these are approximately the same as Swords, Pentacles, Wands, and Cups. The fifth element of the movie: Love, is our "discernment."
