Tommy was very upset: her skin left an imprint on the chrome and he wants her to pay for the re-plating."

You can imagine my surprise when I found there is club that has a chain of resorts called the Tropic of Oregon."
      T.p => T.raw "Membership is very selective and it involves a yearly check up by a proctologist to make sure you’re not an asshole.  Once inside, the weather changes remarkably, warm and inviting – balmy scents in the air.  Lots and lots of aloha shirts.  The members are very giving of their time, energy and expertise.  A very industrious bunch dedicating their lives to increase their animal magnetism using the fabled chinese medicine, green elephant horn.  This elephant has been decimated in it’s natural habitat with laws passed against owning, poaching, use or transportation.   Still, zoos in the tropics are granted special dispensation, and so, the ‘Tropic of Oregon’ society was created to satisfy the legalities of owning, raising and using at protected zoo-resorts.  The Tropic of Oregon is dedicated to preserving, breeding, training, and all uses of the Green Elephant."
      T.p => T.raw "I spoke with the local representative, Ho Tai, while sipping kambucha and worm-tea (note to self: read the label next time).  He shared secrets of the occident coupled with tropical wisdom that has been suppressed for decades.  It seems that at one time elephants were legal and roamed freely in the US until the Great Depression; the beef market was nearing collapse.  Viciously suppressed by congress in the intervening decades, the green elephant, once on the verge of extinction, is making a comeback.  Tropic societies are forming in several states to assist this transformation.  Ho Tai says &quot;The benefits of proper management of Green Elephant horn stagger the imagination but will benefit the nation. Like sex, the Green Elephant is here to stay.&quot;"
