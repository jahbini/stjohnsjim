Wahh, my stomach cries for comfort food, which is a no-brainer:  I order the awesome chops.  Mmm, very tasty.  It’s Sunday in October and the weather in St. John’s today has the trademark stamp of San Francisco’s bone chilling Summers.  This is the kind of day that you think twice about closing a door because the great refrigerator light in the sky might go out."

Bill paid for my two degrees in Computer Science, but without much left over for shoes, creating a huge gap in my impoverished student armor against the half-frozen slop that covered the ground.  A little salted ice between the toes can really make a boring lecture intolerable."
