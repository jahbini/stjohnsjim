      T.p => T.raw "He sits on an old log. He takes a moment to go through his belongings: the sword of confidence, the wand of capability, the pentacle of prosperity and the cup of integrity. His dog, Dizzy, sniffs his boots. He continues: “I think I like this place. Hey Dizzy, I’m tired of thinking, anyway, and you sure like it here. And that’s just fine.”"
      T.p => T.raw "I’m here to find my way, learn new things. If there is anything important, Dizzy, we will know it. And then I don’t have to think about it anymore. Maybe I can teach it to you."

I call you Discernment, or mostly, just Dizzy. You are, well, a second body for me. Like a cup waiting for me at nightfall. And I will fill the cup, and we will move on as one again."
      T.p => T.raw "And the pup replied “Hey buddy, are you on crack? You make no sense at all.”"
      T.p => T.raw "No, I’m the fool, and I do make sense, in fact, I only make sense, and let you do the thinking part. Did you know I used to have a monkey? It thought all the time and figured it was in charge, so I traded my monkey for you, Discernment. I lost my mind and came to my senses. Later on, I’ll teach you that you really are not a dog, but right now, it works out just fine."
      T.p => T.raw "And the dog replied: “I’m not a real dog? What the… That’s what I get for talking to a fool. And not just any fool, This Fool of all Fools. I better watch this guy pretty closely, or we will both be killed.”"
      T.p => T.raw "Hey, wait, Dizzy, where are you going? You’ll get us lost, oh, look, what a good dog, you found a path. Let’s go see what is just ahead…"
