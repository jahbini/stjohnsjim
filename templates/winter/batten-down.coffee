      T.p => T.raw "The leaves from the trees had been thick on the ground in St. John’s Park and I loved hearing the crunch-swish as I walked through them. The were all picked up by the park department recently. I could have, would have, should have saved them by laying down in front of the machinery, but the Election of The Donald put me in WTF?!?? spiral."

Throntle is able to tackle a John, walk around the block, and return with twenty dollars, two new diseases and a normal body temperature. If there were hooker movies like samurai flicks, Throntle would have ballsy moves that"

It’s too cold for beer, so I’m looking for the recipe for Werm Tea. I’m going to need it, as I’ll not be using Throntle as a hand-warmer."

Nobrow has erected a blockade at the entrance to St. John’s near the St. John’s Beer Bus. In his position as recycling specialist he walks a beat of trashcans and maintains a vigil to protect St. John’s. He is planning to apply for a grant to install airport screening devices to save us from these giant gelatinous horrors. Big Sis doesn’t approve, but we know Big Brother Grabbed her by the pussy."
      T.p => T.raw "There is one advantage to barren trees in St. John’s in the winter: It’s easier to get tiny peeks of the bridge — Just step outside the front door of the James John Cafe, and you look straight down the roadway of the magnificent St. John’s bridge – barely visible through the twiggy trees. The bridge with the endlessly useful, absolutely graceful span beacons and sends the message that hope awaits."
