      T.p => T.raw "I had been a temple virgin for many years. I thank Apollo for restoring my innocence 1000 times and more. Apollo requires great sacrifice on the part of the adherents, you know. That is proper. Apollo has seen fit to allow me to open my womb to four new souls, although only two survive. These grace-filled two are steadfast in their observation of Apollo’s rules.

I wanted to behold Apollo, and Apollo has shown me the world beyond the world. My worldly eyes are freely given to you, Apollo, for the gift of truly knowing who you are."
