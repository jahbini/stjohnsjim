      T.p => T.raw "I saw a performance by a Jackie Evancho, a truly gifted child with a fabulous voice. It is the kind of voice that inspires any well-connected agent to call God directly and schedule her try-out for the voice that announces the Second Coming of Christ. In song, she carries the Gravitas of Morgan Freeman, The World-Wise qualities of Nelson Mandela and the resonance of Kate Smith. She is equally at ease in duets with Barbra Streisand or Susan Boyle."
      T.p => T.raw "Like I said, fabulous. But with an odd hitch. Watching her sing weirded me out. Not just me, a couple of other people mentioned the same thing. Why should excellence be weird?"
      T.p => T.raw "My guess is that it had to do with her child like nature. A kid is not supposed to know all about the emotional depths of intense life and death romantic love that is needed to understand Bernstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Place for Us.&rdquo; But this kid conveyed that emotion perfectly."
      T.p => T.raw "Close your eyes, you would swear that this soul had swam in hormone hurricane churned seas &mdash; slammed against the sad rocks of society&rsquo;s expectations &mdash; and finally accepts the doom of Romeo and Juliet."
      T.p => T.raw "Open your eyes, and you see a body that should be singing &ldquo;I love Barney,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sharing is Fun.&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "In the same way that &ldquo;Little Miss Sunshine&rdquo; pointed out the creepy nature of Pre-pubescent Beauty Queens, this young lady has poked a similar button. But she has done nothing wrong, and is just expressing her gifts as a performer and a human being. Like &ldquo;Little Miss Sunshine&rdquo; herself &mdash; simply a little girl with a dream and some inspired coaching, she is reaching for a goal that inspires her. The abreaction is mine alone, It is me."
      T.p => T.raw "It&rsquo;s MY expectation of human development that gets punched in the nose by the &ldquo;fist of perhaps.&rdquo; &mdash; either children have a greater emotional capacity than I know, or that she is simply a capable performer who can &ldquo;fake&rdquo; the emotions with expert ease. An actor does that for breakfast, lunch and dinner, why not a little girl? After all, it&rsquo;s just a performance."
      T.p => T.raw "Obviously, the answer is both."
      T.p => T.raw "But if she sings The Kink&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lola&rdquo; with equal passion, I am running for cover! Lord save us all."
