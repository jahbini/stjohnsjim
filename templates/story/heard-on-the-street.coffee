I replied: &ldquo;Yes, no lights.&rdquo; Always agree. Simply acknowledge. It&rsquo;s a Ninja Trick when you are confronted with a feeble old grouch. &nbsp;Keep Walking."

      T.p => T.raw "I was a bit baffled, I did see porch lights, and it was daylight. What kind of lights was he thinking of? This is when I wish I was a member of the Church of Who Gives A Fuck. I look back and he is still spouting off to the building as he shuffles his walker along. Did he want a neon sign? Theatre spotlights? An enema? &mdash; it would give him something else to think about."
      T.p => T.raw "The hooker on duty in front of the Hope for Health bar vaguely threatens some people waiting for the bus: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess with me, I do blow jobs to get that testoster crap.&rdquo; She has her hand on something in her purse. Keep walking. Where did she learn a big word like that?"

No Gun, No Gun.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dog Green Excrement Recycle.&rdquo; He usually repeats everything he says at least twice. It never makes any sense whatsoever. He thinks he is invisible &mdash; No one ever notices him because he is talking on a pay-phone. Yes, shouting through a pay phone, hanging up and dialing repeatedly without putting coins in is a perfect disguise."
      T.p => T.raw "Nobody, but nobody, screws with Phone Jack. &nbsp;Very bad Juju to screw with someone who has the intellectual skills of a Labrador Retriever. &nbsp;Keep walking."

It&rsquo;s a Ninja Trick when you are confronted with a Business Genius. It&rsquo;s the perfect idea for a lot on an industrial arterial with no parking or foot traffic. &nbsp;Yup, you guessed it: &nbsp;Keep walking."
      T.p => T.raw "I bet an enema would give him something else to think about. That ninja trick wouldn&rsquo;t work on Phone Jack though. &nbsp;No brains, no headaches."

      T.p => T.raw "That&rsquo;s St. John&rsquo;s. Just when you thought you figured it out, there is a whole new subculture existing in a parallel dimension.&nbsp;"
