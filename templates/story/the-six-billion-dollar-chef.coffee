      T.p => T.raw "Of course you have heard of the “iron” chef — able to take on all comers with a paring knife in one hand and in the other, one bizarre and inedible ingredient. Like crab gonads. What ever you think of as “comfort food,” be assured that the metallized chef will not be cooking that tonight, thank you."

      T.p => T.raw "So, you may not have heard of Samuel Doveout — magna cum laude graduate of the Boca du Linguica School of Gastronomical Broadcasting. His meteoric career, rising from poverty to Chief chef at the La Boca Cuisinaire was paralleled by his TV presentations where he would press huge buttons behind him on the stage so that pre-programmed aromas would be wafted to viewers of his “aroma channel”."

      T.p => T.raw "His food was so popular, that to keep the crowds away, they renamed his establishment to “Sam ’n Ella.”"
      T.p => T.raw "The resulting riot of customers who reasoned: “With a name like ‘Sam ’n Ella,’ you know it’s got to be good” left Samuel in critical condition. Burns on over 75% of his body, and loss of all major sense organs, along with a broken neck and massive injuries resulted in a recovery that took three years, followed by another five to regain his niche along side the cooking greats: (Sweet ) “Bam” Marjoram, Curry Favre, The Incredible Garlique, and Generic Fatguy from Southern Climates."

Yes, he is a quadraplegic, lost his voice, sight, hearing and feeling over 90% of his body. All that remains is his ability to detect the slightest gradations in flavor, texture and aroma. His communication with the outside world is limited to sniffs, jaw and tongue movement."
