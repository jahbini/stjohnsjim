        T.raw "&hellip; But I digress."
      T.p => T.raw "Winnie Daough, you may remember is a whiz-a-holic for creating organic niche products out of found materials. She patented the twig straightener and the blackberry-thorn necklace stringing machine. Blackberry thorn necklaces were a fad in Portland for 2 weeks in 1986, but Winnie has perfected her machine since then."
      T.p => T.raw "Winnie is totally practical when it comes to her life&rsquo;s essentials - in this case, exotic hens. These are her special passion. My eyes glaze over when she mentions the &ldquo;radiated doohicky&rdquo; or the &ldquo;passion pistol, bambino cross.&rdquo; I infer that these are different breeds or chicken neuroses or such."
      T.p => T.raw "She shoots me a look that clearly suggests that I&rsquo;m in over my head: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the unique head feather arrangement, you dummy!&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "I confess that her birds did have handsome top-knots, but I was amazed to hear that there are bird-head conventions and bingo parties at the local armory each Friday evening."
      T.p =>
        T.span ".FBname", => T.raw "Friend"
        T.raw ": &ldquo;"
        T.em => T.raw "What?!? You mean St. John&rsquo;s has an armory?!!&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "St. John’s Jim: &quot;Damndest thing I ever sawd. &nbsp;No armory. &nbsp;I guess twern’t profitable, by cracky!&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "Winnie went on to tell me that her biggest problem was hen-pecking order and those beloved top-knots. An unter-chicken gets pecked and goes bald, and that means lost profits. &nbsp;Winnie was not going to let some uber-chicken screw with anybodies top-knot."
      T.p => T.raw "Winnie concocted a batch of hen-hat goo that she put on daily. The first batch was based on super-glue, but having a beak stuck to a hens top-knot reduced its value on auction night."
      T.p => T.raw "By the fourth batch, Winnie has hit on yet another amazing use for some household animal by-product. You should thank me that I didn&rsquo;t ask what it was. She told me anyway. Cat drool."
      T.p => T.raw "The long and short of the product is that when a hen pecks another, the pheromones of the cat get released on to the offending hen and she starts spewing at both ends and running away from herself. A feat that only a frightened hen can achieve. Or society."
      T.p => T.raw "And then I asked the key question: &ldquo;Winnie: Are you sure it&rsquo;s legal to deal in chicken scalps?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "And Winnie replied: &ldquo;Yup, I’m making out big time, and they&rsquo;ll make that illegal too, soon enough!&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "That’s the way it is in St. John’s on February 9, 2011. &nbsp;Where it is tourist season every day at rush hour for 45 minutes. &nbsp;Then they go to sleep. &nbsp;They are gone by morning."
