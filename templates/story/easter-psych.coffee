I missed the sustainable tree-house aerial ride-share tram at 5:30 AM, though. &nbsp;The weather was hard to figure out in the dark of the morning. &nbsp;Mostly wet. &nbsp;Cold too. &nbsp;Some wind. &nbsp;I began to suspect that Summer was trying to have Winter cover his shift."
      T.p =>
        T.raw "I find Easter a confusing holiday. It scampers around the calendar like a goat. Too much like Aries. &nbsp;The local Portland custom is wet, with possible cold and wind. &nbsp;As I waited for the ride-share that never came, I thought: Cold, wet and wind is weird for&nbsp;a kama’aina like me. &nbsp;And what about weird local customs like"

Egg hunts, unlike witches or crucifixion, have nothing to do with established Religious teachings. &nbsp;Now I could go into some anti-religious rant as some others might do, but I’m not going to do that today. &nbsp;However, if you ask, I can point you to wonderful mythological similarities. &nbsp;One of my favorite writers on the subject is"

A kid that gets the most eggs might just be the kid that finds the most berries or herbs. And you don&rsquo;t have to be a genius, just patient and persistent."
      T.p => T.raw "As the dawn breaks, and I realize I’m not going to see the St. John’s Fabled Sunrise through the wheels of a locomotive, my eyes see more of the foggy ground below: &nbsp;indistinct– is that a snake or a hose? is that a foothold or a noose? &nbsp;Donald Trump’s wig or a Molotov Suppository?"
