Yeah, that’s a good idea, so you can be with the people and find out what they like instead of just being outdoors and simply lurking around till June.

In St. John’s, Winter starts on the first snowfall after Christmas, and continues until there are two consecutive days that you can go outside without long underwear. That’s when Summer begins. Autumn may lose his job next and we can run on two seasons. So get your head on straight, Spring, just do what you need to do.”"
