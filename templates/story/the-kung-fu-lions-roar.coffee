        T.raw "read about how gangs of well trained Martial Arts experts are devastating the thugs. Thugs pretty much stay away from real trouble and don’t like to be on the receiving end. Absolutely none of the folks who take Poekoelan have mentioned the actual street fights they have had. Mostly because the more you know, the less likely you are to use it. It builds character quickly."
      T.p => T.raw "The instructors are patient, supportive, competent and positive. Underprotected folk like women and children learn and understand the effect of these moves and become self-protected. And that feeling of self protection is really needed for kids so they can mature well. For the vulnerable, it is too easy for goals and values to be hijacked by peer-fear pressure if there is a lack of self-protection and self-capability."
      T.p => T.raw "Poekoelan Tjimindie Tulen for self-protection and self-capability. It’s that good. Until I get better at it, I’ll rely on The Lion’s Roar. Scottish Bagpipes: Beware!"
