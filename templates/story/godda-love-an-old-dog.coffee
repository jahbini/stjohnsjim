      T.p => T.raw "So I’m walking: right brain happy to be outside and marking all the telephone poles and fire hydrants. Ideas for writing? &nbsp;Nothing.&nbsp; Something.&nbsp; &quot;I went to India?&quot; Nope.&nbsp; &quot;India went to Jim?&quot;&nbsp; Possible.&nbsp; Might work.&nbsp; Actually happened, too…"
      T.p =>
        T.raw "But nothing solid.&nbsp; Lots of thoughts: &quot;put the Tarot writing on-line&quot; …&quot;"

        T.raw "&nbsp; So I walk back to check the door.&nbsp; Still no great ideas.&nbsp; Looks like this will be a late edition, and that will cut into story book hour over at Slim’s – That’s a no-no: the old dogs there have well earned stories."
      T.p =>
        T.raw "One of them, Ulysses has unkempt whiskers poping out of his stocking cap like some fungal puff-ball.&nbsp; His line is ridiculously monotonous: he always asks for money, and instantly follows up by saying &quot;I haven’t had a drink in 10 years&quot; – I think: &quot;I don’t give a crap what you do when you have money,"
        T.em => T.raw "do you have a good story"
        T.raw "?&quot; – Joan of Arc walks up and says &quot;Jim, he’s scamming you.&quot;&nbsp; Thanks, Justice, but his story will be bought cheaply, I assure you. Mwa - Ha - Ha…"
      T.p =>
        T.raw "Finally I’m headed out.&nbsp; Late.&nbsp; What to write about?&nbsp; Not a good idea in the batch."

      T.p => T.raw "I shout: &quot;Godda love an Old Dog&quot; – He shouts back: &quot;Thanks&quot; as he leads his cherubim companion slowly back home.&nbsp; He knows the inevitable – It takes love. &nbsp;Right brain uncorks a bottle of compassion, responsibility and pathos and serves it up in my cup of life."
      T.p => T.raw "And Ulysses’ story.&nbsp; It will be bought cheaply: a few dollars, some honest interest in him as a human being, and a feeling that he is heard will be the price. &nbsp;It isn’t expensive, just precious. &nbsp;Godda Love an Old Dog."
      T.p => T.raw "All us Old Dogs need it. &nbsp;I thank my Right brain for paying attention to this and my Left brain for putting it into words, both are well loved Old Dogs to me. (High Five, right brain, I knew you could do it!)"
      T.p => T.raw "And yes, in a sense, India DID go to Jim.&nbsp; I’ll tell you about that, too."
