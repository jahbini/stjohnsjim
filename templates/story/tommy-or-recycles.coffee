      T.p => T.raw "I&rsquo;m sitting on the back stoop over at 3 Gunas Lp.&nbsp; Tommy and Southwick are there.&nbsp; Roger, 70, veteran of service aboard the &ldquo;USS Homer Simpson,&rdquo; is very comfortable with predictable stupidity and reliable chaos.&nbsp; So he gets along with both Southwick and Tommy, just by saying &ldquo;yep&rdquo; or &ldquo;ya think?&rdquo; Mostly Roger rides his Harley over to his lady&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t ride: she isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;Harley&rdquo; chick, but at 67, few are.&nbsp; Roger decides to park his Harley under her bed this night."
      T.p => T.raw "Southwick is new to Oregon, and Honolulu is 30 years behind the times when it comes to recycling.&nbsp; So he asks Tommy, who says: &ldquo;Business got a reality check in the &rsquo;70&rsquo;s.&nbsp; All that &ldquo;clean up the environment&rdquo; claptrap.&nbsp; Business is the same to me: They paid us to dump crap into the river, and now they pay us to get the crap out of the river.&nbsp; Same either way.&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Southwick wants to know about what&rsquo;s recyclable and how:&nbsp; Tommy says: &ldquo;Just throw it all together.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the best way. Return to Maker.&nbsp; Let Nature take care of it.&nbsp; Either way it goes out by barge, and &ldquo;Waterfront U&rdquo; controls the tugs and barges from here to the ocean.&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Southwick foolishly asks Tommy the wrong question, &ldquo;What exactly do you do at Waterfront U?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy replies: &ldquo;Everything on the water:&nbsp; I design &lsquo;em, build &lsquo;em, pilot &lsquo;em, dredge &lsquo;em, dump &lsquo;em, demolish &lsquo;em.&nbsp; Tugs, barges, day care centers, dredges &mdash; Anything that takes brains and muscle on the water.&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Southwick asks: &ldquo;Day care centers?&nbsp; Food carts, too?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy looks away and changes the subject: &ldquo;The Old Man always asks ME to do the hard jobs.&nbsp; I had to design a 300 foot dredge that could separate gold from seawater at the rate of 20 Whalesheads per fortnight. He asked me to soup it up to pull his water skis.&nbsp; Just launched it last week.&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy&rsquo;s word salad seems to make sense, and that scares me.&nbsp; I decide to leave 1950â€™s Tommy, OR, and take my exit through the front door of 3 Gunas Lp.&nbsp; As I leave, I hear something about the team of Nobel prize winners he had to manage."

        T.raw "sometimes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m lucky tonight, I enter, and although we don&rsquo;t shake hands, respect is the first and last words that make the bookends of our conversation.&nbsp; His son finds an ookie bug on one of the plants for sale and brings it over as we talk.&nbsp; He takes it gently, it&rsquo;s not an inside kind of bug, and takes it outside so it may continue on it&rsquo;s path."
      T.p => T.raw "We talk higher reasoning.&nbsp; Each of us is on our path, we come from yesterday and move through today.&nbsp; We move forward or not according to our own choice and power.&nbsp; Where each of us are on our path is not known to others.&nbsp; Southwick, Roger, and Tommy, too.&nbsp; Church is over.&nbsp; Respect."
