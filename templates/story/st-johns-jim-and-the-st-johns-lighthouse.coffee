      T.p => T.raw "He sleeps in a junkyard.&nbsp; Has a girlfriend on heroin.&nbsp; She wanted $20 for a fix, and Nobrow wouldn’t give it to her.&nbsp; She went off an hour earlier with another guy who was going to get her a fix."
      T.p => T.raw "He sipped his beer and often looked across the street at the bus stop and replayed that moment.&nbsp; He described the look they had exchanged through the bus window.&nbsp; A mixture of defiance, surrender and regret all rolled into one.&nbsp; Nobrow wistfully said he was going to spend a month at a friend’s farm and live outside until the cold came on strong."
      T.p => T.raw "We shared a brew at Slim’s in St. John one afternoon.&nbsp; The call of nature broke up our conversation, and when I came back to the bar he was talking on the phone.&nbsp; &quot;… Yes, love you.&nbsp; I just wanted you to keep on the up and up, and not make the mistakes your old man’s done.&nbsp; …&nbsp; Your dad hasn’t had a drink or anything today, honey.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;… No, It’s not right that he punched you.&nbsp; …&nbsp; Go get in contact with the half-way house we had talked about. &quot;, He went on like that for a few minutes. &nbsp; &quot;I love you.&nbsp; Take care.&quot;&nbsp;"
      T.p => T.raw "Nobrow could be a derelict in society except for deep connections.&nbsp; He said that he talked to a small group of people everyday.&nbsp; His daughter, his ex-wife, his brother…"
      T.p => T.raw "It’s the connections.&nbsp; We each have a few.&nbsp; Let them slide away only at great peril to the resident.&nbsp; John Donne spoke of the promontories of humanity with &quot;no man is an island.&quot;&nbsp; The promontories of our personal firmament are composed of these gossamer connections.&nbsp; The loss of one, even a tenuous and difficult connection, is grounds for sorrow.&nbsp; And in a troubled life, even a difficult connection is a haven."
      T.p => T.raw "When we run out of havens, what will we do?&nbsp; I’m glad Nobrow has safe havens for the resident of his world.&nbsp; He will be cheerful and connected with reality at least as long as he exchanges love with his personal support group."
