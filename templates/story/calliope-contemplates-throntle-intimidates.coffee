Our Overseas weather supplier is shipping early to avoid the holiday rush. Yup, cold to the bone. Followed by rain, rinse, and repeat with clear evening skies. This is fine, handcrafted early winter. Kudo’s to our Overseas supplier: we wish you could have given us the same service with Summer."

      T.p => T.raw "&gt; Sandy has first hand information on these grossly deformed blobs. As if a blob could be deformed. According to Sandy it’s Gospel. (Sandy is very observant — even a detail like shapelessness does not escape his bleary eye.)"
      T.p => T.raw "&gt; Southwick has been eating mountains of salt with Sandy: Says it has something to do with Street Cred. I think it has more to do with training for the upchucking contests at the Hope for Health bar. In any event, Southwick is following Sandy’s every twitch. He also mentions that salt takes the edge off Sandy’s breath. It’s now a blunt weapon."

Nobrow comes by like the Pied Piper leading Throntle and the other hookers. These street ladies quickly intimidate the bejesus out of the Amoebas (“What are YOU looking at… Hell no, I’m not washing it, It’s good enough as it is… Hey, blobby, you got a light?” ) The blobs quickly scatter and the hookers move on, muttering about how these amoebas are such dickless wads."
      T.p => T.raw "&gt; Who would have thought it? Hookers keeping St. John’s free from Amoebas! Tommy won’t confront Nobrow’s army; he knows the hookers would tell all their secrets — Like Tommy sleeps with an anatomically correct rubber ducky. And that’s not the worst of it! Southwick now has the complete picture of who, how and why."

(It’s hard to imagine that Southwick really believes Sandy, but hey, at the St. John’s Lighthouse it just might be true, and that’s good enough for this story!)"
