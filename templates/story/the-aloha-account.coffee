Only the threat of early death due to starvation is forcing me to actually deal with the economic nasty. Wish me luck. On the plus side, I am having a bit of good experience with mint.com, but I really don&rsquo;t like all my financials collected in the cloud. However, the convenience overrides prudence in privacy, and I am seldom prudent. I&rsquo;m a good american that way &mdash; in the USA we have learned that citizens almost always go for convenience instead of prudence. Just say&rsquo;n."
      T.p => T.raw "I just can&rsquo;t keep track of envelopes, or nearly anything that contains money, but I am finding a way around the &ldquo;put your money in envelopes and hand it out&rdquo; philosophy. Just buy things one month ahead of time. For the things I can&rsquo;t buy in quantity, here is how it works: I set up pre-paid accounts with the merchants that I do business with. I tell them I want to give them a month&rsquo;s worth of money NOW in exchange for services. The merchants seem to like cash in hand, you know. They figure out the easiest way to keep track, and all I have to do is keep these accounts topped off once a month."
      T.p => T.raw "One of the merchants put up a wild-west poster of me saying &ldquo;PRE-PAID, never carries cash.&rdquo; where &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; would be, with a simple tally sheet for the workers. I feel like a notorious celebrity. Every time I go in, I can check up on the status. I can&rsquo;t spend it somewhere else, and I can&rsquo;t lose it out of my pocket. I don’t have to walk around with cash. &nbsp;Pre-payment lowers my risk, and that is valuable to me."
      T.p => T.raw "With this kind of budgeting, I can be assured of good food, ale or a book, maybe an occasional mani-pedi. Pre-payment. I can only do that with merchants I trust. Even so, if a merchant goes belly up, my loss is limited."

      T.p => T.raw "Now here, I&rsquo;m going to throw in a contrast. The merchants in Portland rarely have Aloha. It&rsquo;s more than the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go all out for my customers!&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s like &quot;my customers are mostly family, maybe you, too&quot;. And in Portland, a merchant with that philosophy might not last too long. The very few Kings of Pentacles in St. John&rsquo;s who reign with aloha have to keep it hidden, lest it be trod underfoot."
      T.p => T.raw "I noticed some of the businesses in HNL really had seemed to open up to the level you only get from functional extended family. It&rsquo;s the hanai thing. A common custom in Hawaii is the hanai relative: extended adoption that ignores race lines. Ohana is not by blood or marriage alone. The guy who wrote &ldquo;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&rdquo; was a hanai kid. Some of you readers are my ohana, maybe you all are."
      T.p => T.raw "You saw that in everyday transactions between folks. &nbsp;They treat each other as if they were family. It&rsquo;s more than the &ldquo;some of my friends are African-american&rdquo; &mdash; It&rsquo;s &ldquo;some of my family are Chinese, Japanese, Iranian, Jew, and yes, Hawaiian.&rdquo; The hanai concept of family seems unknown in the mainland."
      T.p => T.raw "That&rsquo;s aloha, the feeling that you are being treated like family."
      T.p => T.raw "To those folks that have shown me great Aloha, I would want to be able to open up an Aloha Account to Post-Pay for all the goodness that you have shown. You know, pay it backward.
