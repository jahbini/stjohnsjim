What that exact catalyst might be is different for each species. Duration of the day? Spectrum of light? Humidity? Some wierd pheromone secreted by slugs?"
      T.p => T.raw "It’s Saturday market day in St. John’s. It’s August. Nice. It will stay that way all day. I’m walking over to the James John Cafe and have to cover my tracks to keep it’s location secret. I take the complicated route through the farmer’s market. Just then, a father comes trudging by on his way to the car. His son, a cute poster-boy for the terrible twos, is about to make his big move."
      T.p => T.raw "Father drudges along with a bouquet of flowers, his hand steadying and assisting the boy on the wooden trike. You know, one of those walk-em push-em kind that are so earth-wise trendy."

      T.p =>
        T.raw "The son is wobbly on his three wheeler and gets off to push, then gets on, wonders why it isn’t moving. He complains to dad, who just says, “come along.” The tot looks around and sees a beautiful cake through a shop window. The boy’s mind instantly goes into party mode."

So, juggling his load, dad runs into the store, his kid now making a bee line for the tables in back. The kids mind is locked on the idea of crawling up on some friendly mommy style lap and scamming some cake."

The cat box leaks and the floor underneath has leprosy. The handle came off in your hand as you tried to get in the van during the hailstorm. Those kinds of things catch our minds up in “the heat of the moment.” But as the years allow that heat to cool, around about the maturity of August, laughter and compassion become the emotions surrounding those old moments. Quite a better harvest, you know."
      T.p => T.raw "I look at the many folks in the market square. Most are at that pre-laughter, heat of the moment, state of dealing with life in these United States. But really, how serious is serious? And need it really be solemn? There is a big difference, you know. Like the difference between humans and corporations. St John’s Jim once famously said: “Make things as serious as you want, but never more than they need.”"
      T.p => T.raw "For dad, my casual “good times” comment is like a catalyst to get to laughter just below the surface. I wonder what might for the rest of us? For me, I take laughter in my own ability to get in my own way, and that it all works out. Mostly."
