No real retirement benefits or huge divorce settlement.  Down and Out, it seems.  Always at the bars, always on the sidewalk.   She is totally at the mercy of whoever might help her."

No, not your peril;  Gaze at your benefit.  But her gift of emotional expression is near the end of it’s ride.  What now?  I don’t think Lola looks at life that way.  She is always ready with a smile that uplifts."
