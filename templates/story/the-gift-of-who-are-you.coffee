      T.p => T.raw "Coo talks of the children: &ldquo;With all the stress at school, teen hormones and peer pressure, it seems everyone is putting things onto the kids, but nobody seems interested in who the kid is. So sometimes I sit with each of my children and ask &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; You know, like: &lsquo;How would you describe yourself?&rsquo; &lsquo;Tell me about you.&rsquo; And I just listen, and just keep letting me tell them about who they think they are.&rdquo;"

      T.p => T.raw "As luck would have it, a buddy sits next to me at St. John’s Grand Central Tunnels as I enjoy the inconsistancy of the Portland sunshine. I recap the conversation of Bill and Coo to him and ask: &ldquo;So who are you? How do you approach your day to day life?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "He looks at me a bit startled. He wonders if I&rsquo;m really serious. I assure him that I really am interested in the human experience. As we talk, we quickly boil away the surface stuff like the price of gas, or the weather, or even who did what to him. That&rsquo;s external, you know, and it&rsquo;s the internal that is important to each of us."
      T.p => T.raw "I keep listening, and only stop him from time to time to get a better understanding of his view of himself. You know, with questions like: You use the phrase, &ldquo;fine deal,&rdquo; how do you recognize that? What has to be present and what has to be lacking for something to be a &ldquo;fine deal?&rdquo; He talks for at least an hour. I have to bite my tongue a couple of times to keep from stopping his flow with my &ldquo;suggestions.&rdquo; &nbsp;Which indicate &quot;who I want you to be&quot; and is exactly the opposite of &quot;who are you?&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "It&rsquo;s time for me to leave, and as I get up, he says: &ldquo;Thanks, I feel like I know myself better, and I know what I need to do next.&rdquo; I guess it&rsquo;s a powerful thing to know yourself better. What a gift to give to a person: It doesn&rsquo;t cost me a thing to listen, and, I might get a Pabst or two. It sure beats watching Jeopardy re-runs."
      T.p => T.raw "So I walk back down to my palatial estate, and see Bill and Coo quietly multiplexing the duties of builder, gardener, mommy, daddy, companion, provider, nuturer, recycler and sustainer. They wave and say &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; &mdash; I relate my little experience with my buddy a few minutes earlier."
