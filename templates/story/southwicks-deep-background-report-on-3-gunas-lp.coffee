Although Wanda has not been on the scene for a few months, she figures prominently in a continuing battle of ex-lovers. (Author’s note: Southwick dishes me this great stuff for a budding writer. I love it.)"

      T.p => T.raw "Roger is the Navy guy. Navy Retired. Quartz crystal on-time no nonsense enlisted background. After that he worked AGAIN and got a full retirement from a Portland ironwork. If Roger does something, you know it’s totally A-OK (except for the divorce thing.) Mr. no-problem seldom complaining, but often griping. His life is OK, but he wonders about the competence of people he has to deal with. Don’t we all."

High priced industrial land. Or, at least that’s the fog that Tommy puts out. Blustery about even very small things out of place. Snores like a razorback in rut. Tommy is an excellent mechanic, loves to take anything apart, but only can put barges, ships, cars and engines back together."
      T.blockquote =>

The pictures on the ad had blanked out faces, but Tommy had the original picture (?) and put that in an e-mail with the link to the offending ad.
