      T.p => T.raw "Still, as I think about it, I haven&rsquo;t been mugged recently. And then the truth hit me: I have not lost those dollars, rather, I have purchased &ldquo;thug protection insurance.&rdquo; A thief doesn&rsquo;t have to confront me at all, all he has to do is walk behind me and wait for the money geyser shirt to erupt."
      T.p => T.raw "I figure a guy can make 20 bucks in a day of recycling beer cans, but can make 10 bucks in 15 minutes of following me. In fact, the big thugs will fight off the little thugs: it&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s way. I end up with a parade of toughs behind me, and I&rsquo;m able to proceed along my path in quiet bliss."
      T.p => T.raw "Of course I&rsquo;ll not stuff money in that shirt pocket again, but I&rsquo;ll be giving up my thug protection. I&rsquo;ll just start worrying again about protection and insurance. And that costs big time.&nbsp;"
