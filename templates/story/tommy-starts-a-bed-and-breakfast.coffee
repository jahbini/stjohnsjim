      T.p => T.raw "In return, you may name all of your children or grandchildren to the seventh generation after me.&nbsp; For extension of these privileges, have your seventh generation get in touch with my seventh generation."
      T.p => T.raw "So many parties this season!&nbsp; Southwick, the multi-ethical idiot-savant, had to run to get over to an &ldquo;Innocence Reclamation Workshop&rdquo; &mdash; one of those secret santa things, but with enjoyable gift un-wrapping, slow tastes of life&rsquo;s sweetest offerings. &mdash; quite out of pace with Tommy&rsquo;s chaotic county,&nbsp; but that&rsquo;s the difference between the County of Tommy, OR, and Bliss Boulevard."
      T.p => T.raw "If you remember what was up at the House on Gunas Loop, Roger took the last train for the coast &mdash; at least till spring, and Tommy wants to start a bed and breakfast in the vacant room.&nbsp; Southwick asked him about his &ldquo;plan?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy explains it: &ldquo;This is Christmas Party Time!&nbsp; People wanna get a room.&nbsp; Look at all the little hotels downtown.&nbsp; Why go all the way downtown when a couple can come here?&nbsp; Pier Park is a romantic spot for the hookers and the lookers."
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy says: &quot;One time I looked overhead in a tree, and I saw the ghost punk-rocker in the trees, scared the shit out of me, freaking gorgeous, I almost had a heart attack.&nbsp; She stared at me like a big-eyed cat.&nbsp; When she blinked, I wasn&rsquo;t there anymore.&nbsp; Phheeeyu: better than back in the old country where you have to wet your pants so the spirits let you get away.&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy finishes with a flourish: &quot;Pier Park is the prime location! I get their order for Starbucks at Six and come back with it at Check-out time.&nbsp; If they&rsquo;re in a hurry, I just give &lsquo;em directions!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what Waterfront U would call a win-win situation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell &lsquo;em that they could give me the money for Starbucks coffee, OR they could save big by going themselves.&nbsp; A bargain!&nbsp; and everybody wins.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t miss.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what we call &ldquo;early check-out&rdquo; in the trade&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Southwick replies: &ldquo;I can tell you have done your due diligence. You know you will have to advertise.&nbsp; Is that why you took down the panties on the flagpole out front?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy :&rdquo;Absolutely, Tommy, OR has it&rsquo;s own section on Craigslist. I&rsquo;m starting a new scheme.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get both his and hers when they stay here, and put them BOTH up the flagpole.&nbsp; Now THAT&rsquo;S advertising.&nbsp; The room will get the bunny-quickie ribbon in the County&rsquo;s grope-a-thon."
      T.p =>
        T.raw "Southwick decided that Tommy will have fun as an entrepreneur.&nbsp; &ldquo;With your &ldquo;"
        T.em => T.raw "my records are all in cash"
        T.raw "&rdquo; system of accounting, you will never worry.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be washing sheets and making beds.&nbsp; Sounds great!&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy says: &ldquo;Oh, yeah, washing, that will be the deluxe package, and you have to call ahead for that one, mostly we have a sheet-recycling system we like to call &ldquo;Play it where it lies.&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "And of course, let&rsquo;s all say amen to Tommy with his final prayer to his religion: &ldquo;And if they don&rsquo;t like it Who Gives A Fuck?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "We wish the folks in Tommy, OR as much enjoyment as St. John&rsquo;s can handle."
