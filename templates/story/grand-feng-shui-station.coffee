Instead, he picks up his iFaux and starts shouting “FUNG SHUI, FUNG SHUI” — The phone goes silent. In a few seconds it’s screen dark. It is saying “Fung U.”"

Libraries, Google, plans, designs, history, science — Knowledge is #1. That’s a pretty final judgement. Even the Great Pyramids are pipsqueak compared to all human Knowledge. And it is our creation. It lives because of us, and will die with the last human. Pretty fabulous when you think about it."
