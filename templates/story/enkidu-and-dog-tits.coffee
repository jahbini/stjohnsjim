It showed “Big Taunt,” one of the animated characters on The Children’s Trauma Workshop over at the Violence Learning Channel — part of the basic cable package in Tommy, OR. The Children’s Trauma Workshop is the most popular unwatched TV in most households — It keeps the kids amused for hours while mom gets a new tattoo for the dog."
      T.p => T.raw "We like dogs here in St. John’s. No, correction, dogs are more than revered here in St. John’s — These are the lesser angels that we have so that we may learn love. But in St. John’s the wuppies have doggy daycare playgrounds, four pet perfumeries, two dentists and a store that sells writing supplies for doggerel. (Yeah, that’s the kind of crap I do inside a sentence. I can do it with one phrase behind my back in the dark — trust me, it’s good for the brain, keeps you flexible, like fleas for a hound.)"

      T.p => T.raw "Over on the side, I see young children painting on papers on the floor. That’s nice. No Children’s Trauma Workshop for these kids. Mommy skills are strong in this one: she talks to the kids as if they matter (they do) and keeps both hemispheres active in the kids."
