Both the Huffington Post and the Drudge Report reek of nuptuals. The in-your-face, in your room, in your breakfast&nbsp;excitement rivals the Olympics."

It is mostly wasted motion, fun little trinkets of plates and silverware specially made for the occasion, lots of bells (no wonder the peasants wanted to revolt), flowers, corsages and nosegays for every nostril, specialty foods created of unique ingredients with DNA spliced genes specially made for this historic, nay,"

And really your stuff is none of my business. I&rsquo;m only glad that my tax dollars did not pay for any of it. If the Brits were a bit more savvy about merchandising the whole thing, their taxes might not have to pay for it either."

You just can&rsquo;t do that. You gotta add the stuff slowly after the water boils, so I try the microwave instructions. Gotta stir every 30 seconds. That&rsquo;s a pain. And if for some reason, the mixture starts to bubble… Oh, My."

Boiling mush powered by rogue microwave energy will erupt and stick to the bowl, the oven, the sink, everything, even the show on TV. &nbsp;The bride didn’t even have time to duck."

The fairy tale wedding would end in disaster and it’s all my fault. &nbsp;On live TV, yet! A major OMG. Luckily, the remote control was unguarded at the moment. I punch buttons like a wild-man to rewind the signal (do I have to figure out yet another irritating menu scheme for every f**n gadget!?!?) and carefully scrape the goo off her dress and press ‘continue’."
