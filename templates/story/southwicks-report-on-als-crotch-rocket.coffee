      T.p => T.raw "Hi, this is Southwick. &nbsp;St. John’s Jim had to leave the James John Cafe early to get to a dental appointment. &nbsp;Since the Cafe is at a secret location, it takes quite a while to escort him blindfolded out. &nbsp;He asked me to fill in."
      T.p => T.raw "I rent a room in Tommy’s house at 3 Gunas Loop. &nbsp;Roger lives there, too. &nbsp;Roger is a retired Navy Guy. &nbsp;Tommy can’t retire. I’m not sure he can grow up."
      T.p => T.raw "Let me tell you about Al’s new motorcycle. &nbsp;No, not Al Pacino but Al who lives next door:&nbsp; He comes over frequently, and is a shining dark star for Tommy to admire.&nbsp; In another galaxy, they might be exchanging dark-force Midi-chlorians.&nbsp; Here, they are just &quot;Street Smart&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "Al has had a worse set of woman experiences than any of us.&nbsp; Al’s wife left her kids.&nbsp; Seven and Three year old boys.&nbsp; What the fuck does Al know about how to take care of a three year old boy.&nbsp; So he does what he can with the women he can get to help.&nbsp; He has an aunt that watches the kids four days a week, and that’s great, but friday evenings are baby duty for Al.&nbsp; He loves his kids, but he isn’t a mom, and needs to flex his testosterone."
      T.p => T.raw "So Al bought a super-bike.&nbsp; a Suzuki Hayabusa.&nbsp; He calls it his sex-abuza.&nbsp; It’s the Spinal Tap of Motorcycle mojo.&nbsp; A speedometer that goes up to 11.&nbsp; Actually way beyond 11.&nbsp; More like 200MPH territory."
      T.p => T.raw "Al was talking about jumping it for show.&nbsp; I’m not sure Al has 2 IQ points to rub together, but we know it’s just babble.&nbsp; A desperate guy with a desperate fantasy."
      T.p => T.raw "Instead of just humoring him, Tommy goes into his usual, _I did it first, I did it bette_r brag:"
      T.p => T.raw "&quot;My family owns half of the St. John’s Bridge. &nbsp; We rented a Matson freighter in 2006 and equipped it with a couple of ramps.&nbsp; I had a pre-production sex-abuza back then.&nbsp; MUCH hotter than the pigs you can get on the street today.&nbsp; Did you know Oregon laws have cut the allowable horsepower to 1/3 of what it could be!? I was going to jump from the freighter, see, over the center span of the St. John’s Bridge, and land back on the freighter as it passed underneath.&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy cant pass up a chance to take a dig at Oregon laws, especially about a law that doesn’t exist, and goes on: &quot;We had practiced up at out St. Helens property, and I had all the stuff ready.&nbsp; MAN!!! it really blew me into the air.&nbsp; Had the kick of a mule. And landed nice and sweet. &nbsp; Trouble was, the half of the St. John’s Bridge we own does not include the center span, so we couldn’t get permission to do it&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy ended with: &quot;I wish I had the videos we took at our St. Helen’s place&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "Roger, our arbiter of reality, sez: &quot;Yup, That’s what happened&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "Al, spends the rest of the night in a funk, contemplating jumping his hayabusa into the Willamette."
      T.p =>

        T.raw ", Thanks for coming with me to the junkyard backyard at 3 Gunas Loop."
