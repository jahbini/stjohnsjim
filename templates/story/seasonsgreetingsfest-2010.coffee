        T.raw ", popped a few eyes. Elegance now comes in Thai-hot."
      T.p => T.raw "Even in Tommy, OR the fun is Thai hot. It seems SeasonsGreetingsFest 2010 involves lots of calls at 2 and 3 AM."
      T.p => T.raw "&ldquo;NO! She&rsquo;s a Wack Job. No, she isn&rsquo;t here. &hellip; No, a Wack Job, a WACK JOB. I don&rsquo;t take her calls anymore. Tell her to stop texting me.&rdquo; and &ldquo;What bar are you at? You weren&rsquo;t supposed to be out of Jail until Thursday. She said that? You better be gone by the time I get there.&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Of course Tommy never really went to the bar, that&rsquo;s not his style. He is a master of keeping the drama going even while he spins the chnnel selector on the TV. &nbsp;He multi-tasks."
      T.p => T.raw "I have recently commissioned a logo &mdash; my stuff is notoriously deficient in graphics. When I looked at it, it had all the right elements, the artist was faithful to my intent, but&hellip;"

      T.p => T.raw "Tommy’s rule: Just make sure it is at least 10% true otherwise his conscience bothers him. &nbsp;"
      T.p => T.raw "Actually Tommy&rsquo;s conscience does not ever really bother him. He may not win every battle, and is sometimes the one to come out with a bruise or two, but he can not imagine a world where this kind of competition and pettiness does not exist. &nbsp;He is who he is, in the world he sees."
      T.p => T.raw "And since it is the season of giving, Tommy wants to share his true feelings with everyone: misery. Tommy says: &quot;If it’s at&nbsp;least 10% true, try it and fly it&quot;."
      T.p => T.raw "In the logo I look like Casper – ghostly. 0xfff in HTML slang. Pallid to the point of potash. Life-drained. I was not sure at first, so Southwick did a time-displaced mind meld at the meme level by bouncing sub-molecular vibrations off of objects in space."
      T.p => T.raw "The e-mail reply from the cat-goddess was: &nbsp;&quot;Nailed It!&quot; &nbsp;– Accurate feedback is to be rewarded. To both artist and feline-fatale I bid you refresh yourself with a bubble bath and a cigar. Thank you. Your&nbsp;consciences remain clean."
      T.p => T.raw "Roger&rsquo;s conscience, on the other hand, will improve as he laboriously untangles himself from Tommy&rsquo;s innuendos. Tommy started rumors that Roger got out the snow shovel so that Tommy&rsquo;s old fiance could steal it. We wish Roger a grand holiday and quiet future in his new home on the charismatic Oregon Coast. Roger&rsquo;s true feelings: weariness. Roger says: &ldquo;Ya think?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Southwick&rsquo;s conscience is pretty good. Willful acts of moon are not willful acts of evil. Southwick&rsquo;s true feelings: myopic optimism. Southwick says: &ldquo;Who said the dick was the first to go?&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "It&rsquo;s High Noon and I&rsquo;m declaring war on pallid. &nbsp;OK, pallid, I&rsquo;m growing a beard."
      T.p => T.raw "St. John’s Christmas tree trimming saw non-pallid crowd pleaser, Orion Guimond, organize a children’s Christmas tree trimming under the Mayor’s watchful eye. &nbsp;Both the Mayor and Orion’s children’s army enjoyed the moment. &nbsp;The first week of SeasonsGreetingsFest 2010 went very well in St. John’s."
      T.p => T.raw "St. John’s merchant’s true feelings: optimistic."
