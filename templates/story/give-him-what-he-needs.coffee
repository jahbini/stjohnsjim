        T.span ".FBname", => T.raw "Friend"
        T.raw ", this one doesn’t have any boffo laughs, so I’ll have to owe you one. &nbsp;I promise I’ll make it up to you. &nbsp;Read this and think what you might want to ask the wise one.)"
      T.p => T.raw "The Old One feels infirm.&nbsp; His wife had died.&nbsp; He is the elder of the village, and he is asked for his opinion every night.&nbsp; And even if he rambles, all the village still listens."
      T.p => T.raw "One morning he rises and asks for a horse."
      T.p => T.raw "He had not kept or cared for his horse for many years.&nbsp; His sons did that, and he never rode &quot;angry mane&quot; at all.&nbsp; Angry Mane was old too, but was the horse that the&nbsp; Old One wanted.&nbsp; Angry Mane died a few seasons back, and another was never really needed, since the&nbsp; Old One has not ridden a horse for 4 days of the &quot;dead Sun&quot; when the sun lies at the bottom of the sky, and only sacred magic of the Gods brings the sun back."
      T.p => T.raw "So when the&nbsp; Old One asks for a horse, the sons are deferential, and explain that &quot;angry mane&quot; is dead and that he can ride this new steed of fire.&nbsp; Even though the new steed is old and broken down: the gentlest ride in the tribe."
      T.p => T.raw "And the old man tries to mount the horse,&nbsp; He fails repeatedly, and his sons give him a lift on to the back of the horse.&nbsp; He has the horse walk very slowly. &nbsp; And the women look on at this wise, old man acting so odd.&nbsp; And he becomes the topic of the morning."
      T.p => T.raw "The chatter of the ladies causes the chief to go over to the women’s circle and call out his wife.&nbsp; He asks: &quot;What is happening in our village that has all the ladies so chatty&quot; – &quot;My Stallion, I must report that our elder has mounted a horse and is barely moving&quot;&nbsp;"
      T.p => T.raw "The Chief now walks over and asks the&nbsp; Old One where is he going, and will he be back for the evening meal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Old One says that he must visit &quot;great night&quot; – And the chief asks if the&nbsp; Old One knows the way, and the&nbsp; Old One thinks and nods: &quot;oh, yes, Gourd-Shaker knows, I need to have Gourd-Shaker guide me&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "And so Gourd-Shaker is summoned and he is told that the&nbsp; Old One is to visit the land of great night. &nbsp; And Gourd-shaker says &quot;we need much preparation&quot;&nbsp; –&nbsp; For the tribal elder to visit the great night, the shaman wants to have a great festival."
      T.p => T.raw "The chief goes over to the&nbsp; Old One and says:&nbsp; Gourd-Shaker wants 5 days to prepare your voyage, and we have many questions to ask you before you leave:&nbsp; And the&nbsp; Old One said that he would wait 5 days and nights, and answer all the tribes questions."
      T.p => T.raw "And plants were gathered, and hunters went out and brought a great feast.&nbsp; And a fire was built that was bigger than usual, and was to be well stocked with fuel for five full days, and it would channel the source of wisdom for the&nbsp; Old One, but Gourd-Shaker was strong in his statement that it must burn day and night for the full five days.&nbsp; And wood was gathered that would last for five days."
      T.p => T.raw "The preparations over, the evening settled in, and the chief spoke: &quot;we are here to give the elder a journey to great night, we will Give Him What He Needs to make that journey.&nbsp; And in return, he will answer all the questions that you ask:&quot;"
      T.p =>
        T.span ".FBname", => T.raw "Friend"
        T.raw ", What would you ask?"
      T.p => T.raw "And when the feast was over, and the&nbsp; Old One rose the next morning, the Chief and Gourd-Shaker were there:&nbsp; The Chief asked the&nbsp; Old One again if he was going to great night, and the&nbsp; Old One said &quot;Yes, the time is near when I visit great night&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "And Gourd-Shaker and the elder rode slowly away. &nbsp; Gourd-Shaker said that you can only ride a horse part-way to great night.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Old One said that he knew that too, but did not know what other transportation was needed."
      T.p => T.raw "That’s because it is a very great secret of the night gods:&nbsp; The night gods come down when called and visit night god valley. &nbsp; We are going there now, and you will summon the night gods.&nbsp; We will be there by noon tomorrow."
      T.p => T.raw "As they entered night god valley, there were beds raised on stilts, only a very few, maybe 20.&nbsp; As few of the tribe lived long enough to visit great night directly.&nbsp; Most died peacefully in their sleep, in battle, or by accident – Those were burned to send to them to the great night."
      T.p => T.raw "It had been 8 seasons since any other tribe member desired to visit the great night. &nbsp; It was a great boon and meant that the&nbsp; Old One was indeed in touch with the sprits."
      T.p => T.raw "Gourd-Shaker built a bed on raised stilts. He helped the Old One up to the platform."
      T.p => T.raw "&quot;here you must wait for the night gods to come and take you away with their sky horses.&nbsp; They will ride down on silver horses, and they will have one for you, you will go with them.&nbsp; Here is a rattle to shake to beg them to come.&nbsp; They will come when they are ready.&quot;"
      T.p =>
        T.raw "Gourd Shaker called to the spirits with yet another dance and taught the Old One the correct shake to summon the night gods -"
        T.em => T.raw "shake,shake,long shake, long shake"
        T.raw ".&nbsp; Only that sequence would summon the night gods.&nbsp; Gourd-Shaker told the&nbsp; Old One that he was only permitted to teach this special shake here in great night valley."
      T.p => T.raw "Gourd-Shaker rode off."
      T.p =>
        T.raw "The&nbsp; Old One waits until evening.&nbsp; He is not yet hungry,&nbsp; He shakes his rattle.&nbsp;"
        T.em => T.raw "&quot;Shake, shake, long shake, long shake"
        T.raw "&quot;"
      T.p => T.raw "The night gods take their time…"
