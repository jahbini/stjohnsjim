I looked up to find someone in a bear costume with a blue t-shirt that says: &quot;Dental Ben.&quot;  Ben is dancing to entertain kids.  There are no kids.  Ben can’t see out of the tiny holes in his bear mask and dances anyway.  Dancing Bears are not allowed in St. John’s.  Joe Rilla, the bouncer, tells Ben: &quot;Our speakeasy license won’t allow for dancing, come back when you can keep yourself under control.&quot;  And then throws Ben into the street in the pouring rain."

He is concerned that the Mountain Spiders will come down and play catch-em-wrap-em with his Ski-Doos and ATV’s.  He says the big boats and the Corvette are too heavy for the spiders to lift, and he isn’t worried about them.   Southwick tried to tell Tommy that spiders only want living flesh, but Tommy wasn’t convinced: &quot;Basically, we are talking a whole different spider.  And stop talking that Latin shit: ‘Arachno Ursus;’ Nobody’s gonna know what you’re talkin about.  Mom called ‘em Grizzly Spinners, you know, Bear Spiders, the big ones.  They come out of the trees and work in teams.&quot;  Tommy pays attention to the spiders, too."

He knows that for proper aroma a seed has to be licked three times before it is buried.  He watches the blue-jays and the squirrels battle in the &quot;hide the acorn&quot; war.  The Jays rule the daytime with their aerial attacks, and the squirrels have midnight raids on the Jay’s strongholds.  Norman sides with the squirrels.  Norman is safe, the jays don’t know where he lives."

I get to do that from my table at the James John Cafe.  One thing, is that I can ask what you works, and what doesn’t.  Are these too short?  Too long? I’d like to get more explicit with Tommy’s rants, but beware, he really does say some wild things."
