Since that time our privilege has been to bring new life back from death, harvesting it again only when it fell. Every tree, plant and blade of grass is our charge, our flock and our connection with life above where there is the light that burns and kills."

Southward, we thrived and created new memories around the Great Nurturer: Your Willamette. It has been many, many eons since we have been ravaged, and we have finally began to restore our network of filaments in places under the Great Destroyer&rsquo;s riverbed."

It has taken many, many probes and attempts to communicate. Our early attempts led to great pestilence in the valley of the Willamette: the valley of diseases you had called it. We meant no evil, and we have learned your chemistry and your biology and your languages and memories from our probes."
      T.p => T.raw "The sun that nurtures you, is forbidden to us. We only know it as the light that burns and kills. We do know about such things as we can learn below, where there is no sun.

Some of us even fear and hate it. &nbsp;Deeply."
