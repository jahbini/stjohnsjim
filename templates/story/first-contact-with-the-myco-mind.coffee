We co-exist in the same earth, I myself span 6 square miles and my filaments connect directly with a hundred million of my kind."

      T.p => T.raw "Fungal Probes? Mycological mind(s) beneath our very feet? Strong science suggests that the mycological mats of the Pacific North West have amazing interconnections that have been alive and evolving for as long as humanity &mdash; much longer, in fact. Intelligence? Absolutely. How high that intelligence is, or how fast it responds? No idea. Consciousness? Hmmm."
      T.p => T.raw "As I contemplate that question, there is only one thing that I know for sure: &ldquo;As above, so below&rdquo;"
