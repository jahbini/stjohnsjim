      T.p => T.raw "The sounds of the pile driver were with me in my PNW youth. It seemed that somebody needed a huge log hammered into the ground everywhere, and needed to do it 24 hours a day. That may be an exaggeration, but time allows for that – memories are mere impressions of reality, you know."
      T.p => T.raw "So why the activity today? St John’s engines of deafness have been silent for months. So are they replacing old infrastructure? Putting down new pilings? Some sort of jobs creation? Is it a WPA style socialist work scam of the Obama administration, or is it Tea Party darling Rick Scarrie’s free-market cavalry coming to the rescue of the righteous settlers of industry against the savage populace? I took it upon myself to check out what it was."
      T.p => T.raw "I approached the big machine. I shouted to the operator: “Hey! Hey!” He blinked at each bang and crash, but otherwise he didn’t seem to notice. I sidled up to him and put my hand on his shoulder."
      T.p => T.raw "He jumped and hit the ceiling of his cab. He held his hand against his eye and said: “What the hell! Jesus Farts! You nearly gave me a heart attack. Next time give me some god damn warning, you asshole!”"
      T.p => T.raw "I replied: “Sorry, I just wanted to know what’s happening in our economy.”"

      T.p => T.raw "It turns out that it was originally and idea created by scientists from the fabled “Axle of Badness.” Using an abandoned soccer field from an abandoned attempt at holding the Olympics, they set up thousands of pile drivers in a 64X64 grid and with computer precise timing of each driver in the grid, they found they could stimulate the earth miles away."
