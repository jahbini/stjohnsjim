As a response, dental research has found that the optimum number of teeth is 128 instead of 32. Clone research is very close to a breakthrough on this topic. Economic research says that four times more teeth will boost profit after taxes by 326% — expect more teeth than you ever thought possible coming to a mouth near your tongue."

Sailing into the clouds makes it likely that lightning will strike, thus slightly numbing my mouth. After the third lightning strike, he declared that if I walk into the light, he will have my new mouth waiting on the other end."
