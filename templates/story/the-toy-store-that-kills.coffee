The emotion was too hard to handle for this guy and he exploded.&nbsp; Even good memories can be too strong when they come on all at once.&nbsp; The combined effect of remembered childhood hope slammed into the concrete wall of eternal street life without the safety valve of possibility can muck up your whole day.&nbsp; Yup. Spontaneous Human combustion.&nbsp; Happens all the time to drunks.&nbsp; You should be glad he took his legs with him.&nbsp; Usually the feet are left behind.&rdquo;"
