      T.p => T.raw "As Gina drove off, she mentioned ,&ldquo;Hey, I know all about concrete in the tires, try it, estupido, and your career is all over.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tommy loves epiphanies."

      T.p => T.raw "When asked, Southwick said: &ldquo;I promised my professor at ol&rsquo; Newage Sewage State University to keep secret the secret from people who would tell the secret.&nbsp; But even if I tell you the secret, You won&rsquo;t know the secret, cause you can&rsquo;t understand the secret!&rdquo;"
      T.p => T.raw "Southwick continued: &ldquo;Some people believe there is magic in words.&nbsp; It seems to work to organize their thinking and that makes them prone to getting things they want.&nbsp; Not so mysterious when you think about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;"

      T.p => T.raw "Visual – Slow fade from black. &nbsp;Very out of focus – slow movement, maybe through a structure, but very out of focus and dark."
      T.p => T.raw "No words, no story. &nbsp;&nbsp;No story, no Bible. &nbsp;Story preceedes Bible, and words preceed Story, and even before that, chants without words preceeded words."
      T.p => T.raw "Each danger had a chant. &nbsp;Each joy had it’s chant. &nbsp;The first chants were one syllable, and named the most important dangers and joys of the people."
      T.p => T.raw "The chants became longer as they described every thing: Dangers and places, Joys and actions. &nbsp;Joys are always active. &nbsp;Kiss, love, breathe, swallow. &nbsp;Dangers are dark places. &nbsp;Far, Night, Fright, cave. &nbsp;Qualities came next: good, bad, dark, stink. and God and the lesser gods too."
      T.p => T.raw "It was good. &nbsp;It made even an ordinary one, an ancient one, be able to hold the attention of the people. &nbsp;All you had to do was learn the chant. &nbsp;And then there were chants, and soon there were many chants. &nbsp;"
      T.p => T.raw "Announcer is now the Old Man - and we have a close up of his face. &nbsp;(Visual – this is the first recognizable thing in view. &nbsp;Rembrandt lighting - could be polynesian, could be aboriginal, impossible to tell)"
      T.p => T.raw "And each chant was the right chant. &nbsp;&nbsp;And the older of us teach the younger of us all the chants of all the places and things that we know and you must learn."
      T.p => T.raw "So listen to me now, as I tell you the chant of this &quot;Secret Grove:&quot; Some places have chants that are secret and special to them. &nbsp;And only to be revealed to that place: Because that place is also a lesser god, and that chant is for that god alone: no other god may hear it lest it start a god-war: &nbsp;where mountains turn into liquid and the earth shakes. &nbsp;&nbsp;But now that we are here in this grove, this secret grove, I may tell you the name."
      T.p => T.raw "But you must promise, promise never, ever to tell, lest they finish the cutting they started at your man-initiation, that you will never reveal to any but a full fledged man of our tribe these names and chants:"
      T.p => T.raw "So pledge now, or leave this place forever. ( web style presentation: (click here to proceed) – ) Good now I can tell you (Visual: lighting comes up soft but bright – a Spring day)"

      T.p => T.raw "Southwick says there is magic in chants and cheers. &nbsp;If teams can have their own chant and cheers, why not You?"
      T.p => T.raw "Tommy has decided against a career in Pro Wrestling. &nbsp;Gina might just want to wrestle with his memes a bit – he is no longer the &quot;company pier&quot;.&nbsp;"
