      T.p => T.raw "No words, no story. &nbsp;&nbsp;No story, no Bible. &nbsp;Story preceedes Bible, and words preceed Story, and even before that, chants without words preceeded words."
      T.p => T.raw "Each danger had a chant. &nbsp;Each joy had it’s chant. &nbsp;The first chants were one syllable, and named the most important dangers and joys of the people."
      T.p => T.raw "The chants became longer as they described every thing: Dangers and places, Joys and actions. &nbsp;Joys are always active. &nbsp;Kiss, love, breathe, swallow. &nbsp;Dangers are dark places. &nbsp;Far, Night, Fright, cave. &nbsp;Qualities came next: good, bad, dark, stink. and God and the lesser gods too."
      T.p => T.raw "It was good. &nbsp;It made even an ordinary one, an ancient one, be able to hold the attention of the people. &nbsp;All you had to do was learn the chant. &nbsp;And then there were chants, and soon there were many chants. &nbsp;"
      T.p => T.raw "Announcer is now the Old Man - and we have a close up of his face. &nbsp;(Visual – this is the first recognizable thing in view. &nbsp;Rembrandt lighting - could be polynesian, could be aboriginal, impossible to tell)"
      T.p => T.raw "And each chant was the right chant. &nbsp;&nbsp;And the older of us teach the younger of us all the chants of all the places and things that we know and you must learn."
