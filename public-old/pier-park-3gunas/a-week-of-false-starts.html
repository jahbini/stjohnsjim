I even over heard the phrase &quot;I’m getting a degree ‘cause I’m not no douchbag&quot; come out of the TV! But nothing worked.</p><p>&gt; – Help. I need Wisdom, Inspiration, Continuity, Keen Emotions, Dialog, Compassion. I need my muse, queen of the seven chakras and nine tantras: W.I.C.K.E.D. Compassion.</p><p>You see, Tommy convinced me that I had so many projects that I needed to get a replacement for the old-school goddess muse and get a model that pumps out greeting cards, facebook wall comments, ad copy for rent-a-used-fencepost business (that last is a trendy business on the Malibu of St. John’s. — There is a ready made library of twigs, sticks and branches in Baltimore Wood). It just seemed to make business sense. Tommy said he had connections with an overseas supplier.<blockquote class="right key-comment soto right-align h6 p2 bg-white border rounded">soto says: Lets start a community library of tools from old construction projects. People can check out drills, saws and stuff!</blockquote></p><blockquote class="right key-comment voce right-align h6 p2 bg-white border rounded">voce says: So how is that different than what we got<a href="http://www.northportlandtoollibrary.org/">already</a>?</blockquote><p>The MuseCycle 900 was a mess to put together, and the parts and packing are scattered around my mind. I got most of the steps completed and finally got around to reading the instructions. It said: “<em>Attention: requires operation by authentic classic goddess muse</em>.”</p><p>Tommy had scammed me! Can you believe it? Scammed by my own comic creation? I know it’s impossible, but there is simply no other explanation. When the muse don’t sing, ALL explanations work. So believe me.</p><p>I rushed over to Tommy, OR, and knocked. Tommy was hiding in the back. He does that sometimes, in case it’s a bible salesman or old girl friend. I thought: &quot;Tommy, you simpleton, you have no idea who you are dealing with, I’m the fucking AUTHOR!&quot;</p><p>So I unleashed my signature ninja move, the hallowed<em>{{{roar:Roar of the Lion}}}</em>: “Southwick, open the door. Now. Where’s Tommy! What’s he done to my muse! Where is Wickie?”</p><p>Southwick opened the door, and I went out back where Tommy was painting racing stripes on a caterpillar tractor.</p><p>Me: “OK, Tommy, bust loose with the truth, buddy. I’m the author. So help me, I’ll start writing you in the style of Faulkner! You will only be a hollow object of pity. The scum of mythology.”</p><p>Tommy replied: “Oh, no, not that… OK, well you and I thought it would be a good idea to juice up the voltage on the writing thing, and you got all that tree-hugger organic muse fodder and everything.”</p><p>Me: “Muse Fodder! You cant talk about<em>Wicked Compassion</em>that way! A muse is a delicate and sophisticated deity of perfection — able to distill reality into wisdom”</p><p>Tommy replied: “Don’t let no muse fool you: They all want one thing. Anyway, I got her here. She’s no use to me, she doesn’t write porn.”</p><p>Me: “Tommy, if she is going to write porn, she ain’t gonna do it for you, buddy. No more mucking with my muse again”</p><p>–“Not so fast, bub, I’ll make Tommy a porn star if I want to. Look at him there, he’s balancing a beer on his pects, no, let’s make it an outboard motor. Yup, a much funnier image than reality.”</p><p>Me - “Oh, Wickie, where you been, I’m missing you so much…”<blockquote class="right key-comment voce right-align h6 p2 bg-white border rounded">voce says: Did he just call her ‘Wickie’?!</blockquote><blockquote class="right key-comment soto right-align h6 p2 bg-white border rounded">soto says: Just imagine what<em>she</em>calls him!</blockquote></p><p>Wickie - “Well, you could stop chasing me! I’ll come out when I feel safe and want to have a fun time. And more Talking Heads, and Van Morrison, too.”</p><p>Me - “I’ve got a MuseCycle 900!”</p><p>Wickie - “That cheap ass thing, I’ll bet Tommy got it from one of those Chinese Hi-tech sites where he gets his &quot;prescriptions&quot;. Watch out for that stuff!</p><p>– If you are a real author, you’ll get me the MuseCycle 902. It’s got the GB Shaw option. Or would you like Two Weeks of False Starts?”</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
