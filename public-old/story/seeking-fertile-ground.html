Are they really interested in the innuendos of social networking?&nbsp; Or to idolize bad behavior? &nbsp;Or both?</p><p>I’m relieved when I find out they are having a special children’s matinee with the latest Shreck.&nbsp; The St. John’s theatre has children&rsquo;s matinee’s each weekend; the kind of entertainment I remember as a kid.&nbsp; A few ads for junk food, maybe some paper airplanes, maybe some popcorn in the air, and then some seriously silly fun up on the screen.&nbsp; These kids aren’t yet into networks or jackasses, families have enough to deal with as the blessed baby-asses they are still.</p><p>As a true ingesticative journalist, I needed to try out the &quot;chicken bread pudding&quot; from the James John Cafe.&nbsp; More souffle than pudding, this flavor grenade has a mix of textures to keep my tongue happy for the duration of the meal.&nbsp; Infinitely more satisfying than the vegan &quot;chicken breath soup&quot; that my ex used to serve.</p><p>The district of St. John&rsquo;s is fertile ground.&nbsp; Most I meet in St. John’s are dented, recycled, reused.&nbsp; We are the second-hand store of cities, and we are not giving up.&nbsp; In fact, the energies of our visionaries increase daily.</p><p>The city council has been split into two groups, I hear.&nbsp; I spoke to Bambi Brew about it: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the perfect way to build consensus: just get rid of the folks who won&rsquo;t move forward, or want us to go back, like savages, to serving amoebae!&rdquo; &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d get any further information from Bambi: he spoke through tight lips, and I figured there was more to this.</p><p>I talked to the owner of the Cup of Blarn &mdash; &ldquo;Thumper&rdquo; Olsen has the local frozen beer concession.&nbsp; He tells me: &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say anything about Bambi.&nbsp; Bambi&rsquo;s obsession with amoebas might cut into business opportunities. &nbsp;And us &quot;Metro Makers&quot; are all about Business. &nbsp;So we been talkin&rsquo; with the Ethics Department at Waterfront University.&nbsp; Pretty soon Bambi won’t be so important around here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ethics?&nbsp; Waterfront U?&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll need to talk to Southwick over at Gunas Lp. to see if Tommy is involved.</p><p>I went down to the food carts after hours and found the pro-amoeba forces giving &ldquo;the pitch&rdquo; to Peggy, owner of the<em>Peggy&rsquo;s Pills</em>wagon.</p><p>Peggy wants me to mention her slogan: &ldquo;<em>Nutritionally complete, Roughage at your feet</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The floor is covered in free-range organic sawdust.&nbsp; A bit too rustic for my tastes, but St. John&rsquo;s will try anything: we even have a drive-though Hookah Lounge.&nbsp; St John&rsquo;s is fertile ground for crazy ideas. &nbsp;That’s why I’m here.</p><p>The pro-amoeba almost ex-faction of the City Council has formed their own group: the Metro Makers &mdash; and is using pretty strong tactics to support their vision.&nbsp; They have organized the amoebas into picket lines, and are telling Peggy in no uncertain terms that her cart will be the first to be targeted.</p><p>Peggy says: &ldquo;<em><strong>Bring it on</strong></em>, I won&rsquo;t be intimidated into serving them,&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care if the rest of Portland serves &lsquo;em, I don&rsquo;t want their dirty money!&nbsp; Hell, they don&rsquo;t<em><strong>HAVE</strong></em>any money.&rdquo;</p><p>The Metro Makers leave mumbling Tommy&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; I definitely need to follow up with Southwick.</p><p>The rain comes down heavily.&nbsp; Droplets as big around as your pinkie.&nbsp; These are the kind that hit the ground and bounce back up to eye level.&nbsp; They are seeking fertile ground.&nbsp; St. John&rsquo;s is fertile ground.&nbsp; We are still calling out for the seed of transformation: We are the second-hand store of cities, and we are not giving up.</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
