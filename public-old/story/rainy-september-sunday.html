Er. &nbsp; Actually Southwick has no idea of the depths that Tommy’s morals go.&nbsp; Can’t be lower than the urges and actions of our midges and spiders, can it?&nbsp; And well, we do things for lots of reasons.</p><p>It took Southwick a few minutes to come up with the most outrageous answer to Tommy, one that takes a tiny dig at Tommy’s manhood:&nbsp; &quot;<em>If I have to get washed up, she’s not the kind of woman I want to be with</em>&quot; –&nbsp; Nature knows it takes ookie to fight ookie.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
