I’m not sure he can grow up.</p><p>Let me tell you about Al’s new motorcycle. &nbsp;No, not Al Pacino but Al who lives next door:&nbsp; He comes over frequently, and is a shining dark star for Tommy to admire.&nbsp; In another galaxy, they might be exchanging dark-force Midi-chlorians.&nbsp; Here, they are just &quot;Street Smart&quot;</p><p>Al has had a worse set of woman experiences than any of us.&nbsp; Al’s wife left her kids.&nbsp; Seven and Three year old boys.&nbsp; What the fuck does Al know about how to take care of a three year old boy.&nbsp; So he does what he can with the women he can get to help.&nbsp; He has an aunt that watches the kids four days a week, and that’s great, but friday evenings are baby duty for Al.&nbsp; He loves his kids, but he isn’t a mom, and needs to flex his testosterone.</p><p>So Al bought a super-bike.&nbsp; a Suzuki Hayabusa.&nbsp; He calls it his sex-abuza.&nbsp; It’s the Spinal Tap of Motorcycle mojo.&nbsp; A speedometer that goes up to 11.&nbsp; Actually way beyond 11.&nbsp; More like 200MPH territory.</p><p>Al was talking about jumping it for show.&nbsp; I’m not sure Al has 2 IQ points to rub together, but we know it’s just babble.&nbsp; A desperate guy with a desperate fantasy.</p><p>Instead of just humoring him, Tommy goes into his usual, _I did it first, I did it bette_r brag:</p><p>&quot;My family owns half of the St. John’s Bridge. &nbsp; We rented a Matson freighter in 2006 and equipped it with a couple of ramps.&nbsp; I had a pre-production sex-abuza back then.&nbsp; MUCH hotter than the pigs you can get on the street today.&nbsp; Did you know Oregon laws have cut the allowable horsepower to 1/3 of what it could be!? I was going to jump from the freighter, see, over the center span of the St. John’s Bridge, and land back on the freighter as it passed underneath.&quot;</p><p>Tommy cant pass up a chance to take a dig at Oregon laws, especially about a law that doesn’t exist, and goes on: &quot;We had practiced up at out St. Helens property, and I had all the stuff ready.&nbsp; MAN!!! it really blew me into the air.&nbsp; Had the kick of a mule. And landed nice and sweet. &nbsp; Trouble was, the half of the St. John’s Bridge we own does not include the center span, so we couldn’t get permission to do it&quot;</p><p>Tommy ended with: &quot;I wish I had the videos we took at our St. Helen’s place&quot;</p><p>Roger, our arbiter of reality, sez: &quot;Yup, That’s what happened&quot;</p><p>Al, spends the rest of the night in a funk, contemplating jumping his hayabusa into the Willamette.</p><p><span class="FBname">Friend</span>, Thanks for coming with me to the junkyard backyard at 3 Gunas Loop.</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
