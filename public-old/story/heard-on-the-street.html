I replied: &ldquo;Yes, no lights.&rdquo; Always agree. Simply acknowledge. It&rsquo;s a Ninja Trick when you are confronted with a feeble old grouch. &nbsp;Keep Walking.</p><p>I walked passed him as he pointed over to the<a href="http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/MALVINA/mr094.htm">tiki-taki</a>across the street, shouting: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put lights on your condos&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I was a bit baffled, I did see porch lights, and it was daylight. What kind of lights was he thinking of? This is when I wish I was a member of the Church of Who Gives A Fuck. I look back and he is still spouting off to the building as he shuffles his walker along. Did he want a neon sign? Theatre spotlights? An enema? &mdash; it would give him something else to think about.</p><p>The hooker on duty in front of the Hope for Health bar vaguely threatens some people waiting for the bus: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess with me, I do blow jobs to get that testoster crap.&rdquo; She has her hand on something in her purse. Keep walking. Where did she learn a big word like that?</p><p>Phone Jack walks stiffly and has a booming chant like an ah-uuu-ga horn: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m OK, I&rsquo;m OK. No Gun, No Gun.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dog Green Excrement Recycle.&rdquo; He usually repeats everything he says at least twice. It never makes any sense whatsoever. He thinks he is invisible &mdash; No one ever notices him because he is talking on a pay-phone. Yes, shouting through a pay phone, hanging up and dialing repeatedly without putting coins in is a perfect disguise.</p><p>Nobody, but nobody, screws with Phone Jack. &nbsp;Very bad Juju to screw with someone who has the intellectual skills of a Labrador Retriever. &nbsp;Keep walking.</p><p>The owner of an empty lot tells me: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put a volleyball court here, I think it would be a big hit in the Spring and Summer.&rdquo; - I reply &ldquo;Yes, Spring and Summer.&rdquo; Simply acknowledge. It&rsquo;s a Ninja Trick when you are confronted with a Business Genius. It&rsquo;s the perfect idea for a lot on an industrial arterial with no parking or foot traffic. &nbsp;Yup, you guessed it: &nbsp;Keep walking.</p><p>I bet an enema would give him something else to think about. That ninja trick wouldn&rsquo;t work on Phone Jack though. &nbsp;No brains, no headaches.</p><p>Southwick walks over to me and says: &ldquo;The fungus beneath our feet is a whole universe of beings.&rdquo; I reply &ldquo;Yes, beings.&quot; and keep walking. &nbsp;He says: &quot;The &lsquo;shrooms want me to be their drug dealer.&quot; I reply, &quot;Yes, dealer&hellip;<em>Dealer</em>? What the?&rdquo; But by then, I have muffed my damned Ninja Trick and I&rsquo;m trapped.</p><p>Shit, I should have talked to the shuffler guy and I would have avoided this. I say: &ldquo;Are you getting fungally probed again? Are you getting high on &lsquo;shrooms?&rdquo;</p><p>Southwick replies: &ldquo;No, &nbsp;It’s them,<em><strong>they</strong></em>want me to get<em><strong>them</strong></em>high though. The &lsquo;shrooms want me to be their drug dealer.&rdquo;</p><p>Now that&rsquo;s the craziest thing that I&rsquo;ve ever heard on the street. &nbsp;I got to find out more.</p><p>That&rsquo;s St. John&rsquo;s. Just when you thought you figured it out, there is a whole new subculture existing in a parallel dimension.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
