And wish him a very happy birthday celebration. And, of course, is it really salmon run season?</p><p>Tommy from Gunas Lp. is in training as a Pro Wrestler: he signed a long term contract with Gorgeous George, Inc. (A wholly fictional subsidy not associated with the real&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/georgebio.html">GG</a>) to supply him with training, opponents and outrageous costumes.&nbsp; In return he is to kick-back 50% of his proceeds for the next ten years.</p><p>Gina, the sales rep drove Tommy back from the paper shuffle. &nbsp; Gina started singing: &ldquo;Parking spot, Parking spot, there will be a Parking spot.&nbsp; Round the corner there&rsquo;s a parking spot&rdquo; &mdash; And, sure enough, there was a parking spot on Portland&rsquo;s rush hour Lombard.&nbsp; Impossible &mdash; She continues: &ldquo;I can go all down MLK blvd and never hit a light when I sing the right song.&rdquo;</p><p>Tommy, with his usual classy style, says: &ldquo;I like it when you talk like Southwick.&nbsp; Wanna Fuck?&rdquo; &nbsp; (Author&rsquo;s note: Tommy&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;does talk like that, I&rsquo;m not going to dumb it down, sorry.)</p><p>Gina very cordially replies: &ldquo;Tommy, you are a client, and I never fish off the company pier&rdquo; &mdash; Tommy, only at that instant, realizes that he didn&rsquo;t want this lady, she probably had some serious defect, like an intense hatred of Pro Wrestlers.&nbsp; Tommy decided to pump concrete into her tires.</p><p>As Gina drove off, she mentioned ,&ldquo;Hey, I know all about concrete in the tires, try it, estupido, and your career is all over.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tommy loves epiphanies.</p><p>He marvels about how the parking spot appeared, how she knew about the tire thing, and how she had him by the balls professionally. &nbsp; But mostly he marvels about how the&nbsp;<em>parking spot appeared.&nbsp;</em></p><p>When asked, Southwick said: &ldquo;I promised my professor at ol&rsquo; Newage Sewage State University to keep secret the secret from people who would tell the secret.&nbsp; But even if I tell you the secret, You won&rsquo;t know the secret, cause you can&rsquo;t understand the secret!&rdquo;</p><p>Southwick continued: &ldquo;Some people believe there is magic in words.&nbsp; It seems to work to organize their thinking and that makes them prone to getting things they want.&nbsp; Not so mysterious when you think about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Whether by hook, or by crook, it seems to work in practice.&nbsp; Make a word, make an affirmation, make a story, make it a meme and it will prevail &mdash; just listen to this:&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>in the beginning was the word, and the word was good.</p><p>Visual – Slow fade from black. &nbsp;Very out of focus – slow movement, maybe through a structure, but very out of focus and dark.</p><p>No words, no story. &nbsp;&nbsp;No story, no Bible. &nbsp;Story preceedes Bible, and words preceed Story, and even before that, chants without words preceeded words.</p><p>Each danger had a chant. &nbsp;Each joy had it’s chant. &nbsp;The first chants were one syllable, and named the most important dangers and joys of the people.</p><p>The chants became longer as they described every thing: Dangers and places, Joys and actions. &nbsp;Joys are always active. &nbsp;Kiss, love, breathe, swallow. &nbsp;Dangers are dark places. &nbsp;Far, Night, Fright, cave. &nbsp;Qualities came next: good, bad, dark, stink. and God and the lesser gods too.</p><p>It was good. &nbsp;It made even an ordinary one, an ancient one, be able to hold the attention of the people. &nbsp;All you had to do was learn the chant. &nbsp;And then there were chants, and soon there were many chants. &nbsp;</p><p>Announcer is now the Old Man - and we have a close up of his face. &nbsp;(Visual – this is the first recognizable thing in view. &nbsp;Rembrandt lighting - could be polynesian, could be aboriginal, impossible to tell)</p><p>And each chant was the right chant. &nbsp;&nbsp;And the older of us teach the younger of us all the chants of all the places and things that we know and you must learn.</p><p>So listen to me now, as I tell you the chant of this &quot;Secret Grove:&quot; Some places have chants that are secret and special to them. &nbsp;And only to be revealed to that place: Because that place is also a lesser god, and that chant is for that god alone: no other god may hear it lest it start a god-war: &nbsp;where mountains turn into liquid and the earth shakes. &nbsp;&nbsp;But now that we are here in this grove, this secret grove, I may tell you the name.</p><p>But you must promise, promise never, ever to tell, lest they finish the cutting they started at your man-initiation, that you will never reveal to any but a full fledged man of our tribe these names and chants:</p><p>So pledge now, or leave this place forever.
