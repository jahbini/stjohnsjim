Boom. The emotion was too hard to handle for this guy and he exploded.&nbsp; Even good memories can be too strong when they come on all at once.&nbsp; The combined effect of remembered childhood hope slammed into the concrete wall of eternal street life without the safety valve of possibility can muck up your whole day.&nbsp; Yup.
