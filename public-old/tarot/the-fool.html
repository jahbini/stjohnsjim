The fool appears. He has a look of surprise and confusion as he sets his {{{Dizzy:dog}}}, down. The pup races around, sniffs nearly everything and dances happily around his feet.</p><p>“What was that? Oh, yeah, the {{{Contact:contact machines}}}. They always spin me around when I use them. Kind of makes me feel like I have two left feet. Where is this anyway? Sure different here. What a pretty flower.”</p><p>He sits on an old log. He takes a moment to go through his belongings: the sword of confidence, the wand of capability, the pentacle of prosperity and the cup of integrity. His dog, Dizzy, sniffs his boots. He continues: “I think I like this place. Hey Dizzy, I’m tired of thinking, anyway, and you sure like it here. And that’s just fine.”</p><p>I’m here to find my way, learn new things. If there is anything important, Dizzy, we will know it. And then I don’t have to think about it anymore. Maybe I can teach it to you.</p><p>Hmm. Can I teach a dog? I can’t teach dogs things like that! That’s foolish.</p><p>Yes, well, that’s who I am, and you<em>can</em>teach dogs all sorts of things. And Dizzy, isn’t your basic childhood dog, your real name is Discernment of the Highest Good. At least thats what I was told. I call you Discernment, or mostly, just Dizzy. You are, well, a second body for me. Like a cup waiting for me at nightfall. And I will fill the cup, and we will move on as one again.</p><p>And the pup replied “Hey buddy, are you on crack? You make no sense at all.”</p><p>No, I’m the fool, and I do make sense, in fact, I only make sense, and let you do the thinking part. Did you know I used to have a monkey? It thought all the time and figured it was in charge, so I traded my monkey for you, Discernment. I lost my mind and came to my senses. Later on, I’ll teach you that you really are not a dog, but right now, it works out just fine.</p><p>And the dog replied: “I’m not a real dog? What the… That’s what I get for talking to a fool. And not just any fool, This Fool of all Fools. I better watch this guy pretty closely, or we will both be killed.”</p><p>Hey, wait, Dizzy, where are you going? You’ll get us lost, oh, look, what a good dog, you found a path. Let’s go see what is just ahead…</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
