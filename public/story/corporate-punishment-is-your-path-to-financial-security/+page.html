<div id="bloviation" class="article-entry contents" dangerously-set-inner-h-t-m-l="[object Object]"><p>We recently had a Supreme Court decision that allows corporations to have the same rights of freedom of speech as us human citizens.</p><p>Let’s just follow that logic for a moment.</p><p><strong><em>In the world of the future</em></strong>, when Corporations take their place as real citizens of the USA, they must take on real responsibilities.  For example, Jury Duty:  All employees and Board of Directors must serve on Jury Duty, but they must vote as one juror.</p><p>Corporations are efficient –  They keep telling that to us all the time, so they can figure out how to do that efficiently.  Just give our fat-cats a problem, and they can answer the call.</p><p><strong><em>In the world of the future,</em></strong>when Corporations take their place as real citizens of the USA, they must serve time for criminal offenses.  Let’s see how that might work out —</p><p><em><strong>In the world of the future, where General Efficiency has the rights of ordinary citizens:</strong></em></p><p>Salmon- Hey, buddy, what you in for?</p><p>Max- I’m Max, I’m the corporate man.</p><p>Salmon- Wuzzat? Corporate man? I been here since ‘04 and I ain’t heard of corporate man.</p><p>Max- Sheeew, I thought you were an old-timer, don’t you know nothin?</p><p>Salmon- Hey, I been  in high security for too long.  Fill me in.</p><p>Max- Ok, Salmon, here’s how it works.  Back in ‘13 corporations were forced to give up the rights of citizenship, because they were not &quot;people&quot;.  So Fucking what.</p><p>Max- The corporations fought back, and won those rights in the &quot;Christmas shopper VS Walmart Greeter&quot; riot.  Thing is,  they have to do the duties of a naturalized citizen.</p><div></div><p>Max- So, Salmon, corporations have to vote in elections, sit on juries, and serve time for criminal acts.   And I ain’t sitting on any jury.</p><p>Salmon- So that means you are serving time for some corporation?</p><p>Max-  Yup, that’s me,  I’m &quot;Mr. Whizzy&quot; Max.  When near lethal amounts of scum-manium were found in bottles of Mr. Whizzy, heads rolled from Piscataway to Peking.</p><p>Max- I hired on as Corporate Fall guy and got a 10 to 15 year sentence.  That’s enough for full retirement from General Efficiency, Inc!  Along with housing, health and dental benefits for my wife and kids.<em>And Grandchildren.</em></p><p>Max- I got another 3 years before I’m out.  After that, the high level of my incrceration earns me a place on the fucking Board Of Directors!  Today, I may live like a prisoner, but I’m gonna party like a Corporate FatCat for the rest of my life!</p><div></div><p>Salmon- Max, I gotta hand it to you.</p><p>Max- Yea, In fact, if you are willing to get your sentence extended, I can set you up with some sweet corporate deals that will set you up with great &quot;perks&quot; if you know what I mean.</p></div>
