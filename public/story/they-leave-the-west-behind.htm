I have been given the OK by both of them to tell their story here. It involves a computer chip I found in my bar of soap.</p><p>Georgia’s always on my mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mind. &mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p><p>Leo is an international expert in cyber security, and Station is his live-in estranged gay housekeeper. Station is from the Philippines and his name means &ldquo;stations of the cross&rdquo; or something like that, but in English his name sounded too much like &ldquo;crustaceon.&rdquo; He maintains the look of the whole neighborhood: it explains all the papasan chairs in the trees. I&rsquo;m not sure about the estranged part, but they never talk to each other.</p><p>Anyway, Station had been giving me tips on organic gardening: 1/3 perlite, 1/3 moxibustion, 1/3 chicken adobo &mdash; That kind of stuff. By the time he gets to the moxibustion, my eyes glaze over and I try to change the subject.</p><p>Me: &ldquo;Did I tell you I found a computer chip in my soap this morning? It&rsquo;s warm enough today for the pipes to unfreeze, so I took a shower, and in the last sliver of the bar, I found this tiny circuit.&rdquo;</p><p>Station: &ldquo;You should get another brand of soap. Nicer to your skin than&nbsp;computer chips.&rdquo;</p><p>Me: &ldquo;It’s free. &nbsp;I won a contest on the internet a couple of years ago: I get a lifetime supply of Georgia Soap.&rdquo;</p><p>By the time I said internet, Station&rsquo;s eyes glazed over and he kind of wandered down the bluff and continued stringing english ivy in the tree-tops.</p><p>As I walked back to my digs, Leo came running out of their house toward me: &ldquo;I hear you use Georgia soap.&rdquo;</p><p>Me: &ldquo;WTF? Yeah, How&rsquo;d you know? I found a chip in it this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Honey, disconnect the phone. &mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p><p>Leo is kind of a celebrity in St. John&rsquo;s: He always has a couple of bombshell ladies on his arm in public, but he never bring any of them back to his place. He speaks with a bit of a brogue, and is slightly pompous and hardly ever answers a question. He leaves for a few days every so often. Station will just sit outside the front door and wait till Leo gets back.</p><p>Leo: &ldquo;But is the soap any good? Or is it a pube magnet?&rdquo;</p><p>Me: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s soap. Georgia Soap. Soap with a goddamn computer chip in it!&rdquo;</p><p>Leo: &ldquo;Of course. Where you been? Oh, you didn&rsquo;t read the whole Puritan Act, did you?&rdquo;</p><p>Been away so long I hardly knew the place..gee, it’s good to be back home&nbsp;&mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p><p>Me: &ldquo;Uh, no, uh, I was going to, but I never found time. Or needed to go to sleep that badly.&rdquo;</p><p>Leo: &ldquo;Georgia bought out the entire technology from Bogostan when the Soviet Union broke up.&rdquo;</p><p>you don’t know how lucky you are boys&nbsp;&mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p><p>Me: &ldquo;Soviet Union? Technology? They would use a Sledge Hammer to smash an atom. And there in no place called Bogostan. And what’s that got to do with the U. S. Puritan Act?&rdquo;</p><p>Leo: &ldquo;Forget the Soviet Union, I&rsquo;m talking Bogostan. The Bogostani&rsquo;s had electronic surveillance tricks that we are still trying to figure out. It&rsquo;s a country that is so secretive, it erased it self completely from all historical record in 1992. It&rsquo;s mind boggling how they did that, but Georgia owns the technology now. That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t remember. Even now, we are still not sure if Bogostan really exists. That&rsquo;s how good their technology is.&rdquo;</p><p>Me: &ldquo;What<a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=smart+dust&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">technology</a>?&rdquo;</p><p>Leo: &ldquo;The GPS body scanner chips. In the soap, dummy. Don&rsquo;t you read the on-line user&rsquo;s manual for your soap? You had 30 days from first shower, you know. It&rsquo;s referenced in the U.S. Puritan Act under Appendix 23.A.21&mdash; &ldquo;mostly fair use.&rdquo;</p><p>Me: &ldquo;GPS? What the hell for?&rdquo;</p><p>Leo: &ldquo;GPS, you know - Georgia Personal Surveillance – The soap maps out every square inch of your body as you shower. Tussaud&rsquo;s had secretly leased the technology from Bogostan for their Wax Museum: That&rsquo;s why their wax statues are so realistic. Nowadays, the scans are used to generate advertisements tailored to your body contours. I bet you don&rsquo;t get any SPAM about breast enlargement, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>Me: &ldquo;No, I get lots of ads for Peni&hellip;&rdquo; My voice trailed off as the truth hit me. They know. Everything. Every mole and freckle. And it&rsquo;s in the soap!</p><p>Leo walked off down the bluff toward Station. He stopped halfway, awkwardly looked around like a cat trying to pretend he had other business and then ran back toward his car and left.</p><p>Station stood up, walked to the front door of their house and sat down outside. &nbsp;That was over a week ago, and he has been sitting, silently looking up the roadway ever since. Station hasn&rsquo;t done any work on the neighbor hood. The english ivy is still only half-way up the trees.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t get to bed last night, and now&nbsp;Georgia’s always on my mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mind.</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
