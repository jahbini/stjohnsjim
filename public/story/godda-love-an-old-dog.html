Ideas for writing? &nbsp;Nothing.&nbsp; Something.&nbsp; &quot;I went to India?&quot; Nope.&nbsp; &quot;India went to Jim?&quot;&nbsp; Possible.&nbsp; Might work.&nbsp; Actually happened, too…</p><p>But nothing solid.&nbsp; Lots of thoughts: &quot;put the Tarot writing on-line&quot; …&quot;<em>look at that scruffy dog, seems sick</em>&quot; … &quot;put up a web-forum for you,<span class="FBname">Friend</span>, to leave comments&quot; … &quot;Did you remember to lock the door?&quot;<strong>Lock the Door?!?</strong></p><p>Ouch.&nbsp; I forgot to remember if I did.&nbsp;<em>Cant forget what you forgot till you forget it.</em>&nbsp; So I walk back to check the door.&nbsp; Still no great ideas.&nbsp; Looks like this will be a late edition, and that will cut into story book hour over at Slim’s – That’s a no-no: the old dogs there have well earned stories.</p><p>One of them, Ulysses has unkempt whiskers poping out of his stocking cap like some fungal puff-ball.&nbsp; His line is ridiculously monotonous: he always asks for money, and instantly follows up by saying &quot;I haven’t had a drink in 10 years&quot; – I think: &quot;I don’t give a crap what you do when you have money,<em>do you have a good story</em>?&quot; – Joan of Arc walks up and says &quot;Jim, he’s scamming you.&quot;&nbsp; Thanks, Justice, but his story will be bought cheaply, I assure you. Mwa - Ha - Ha…</p><p>Finally I’m headed out.&nbsp; Late.&nbsp; What to write about?&nbsp; Not a good idea in the batch.<em>&nbsp; Crap, There’s that scruffy dog again.&nbsp; Looks lame, starving… &nbsp;<span class="FBname">Friend</span>, Should I call the pound?</em>&nbsp; I see a guy idling his time nearby.&nbsp; Doesn’t he feed his dog?&nbsp; Is he a street-dweller?</p><p>&quot;Hi! Is that your dog? He looks like he needs some help.&quot; &nbsp; — &quot;Yes. … He’s winding down&quot; the guy says slowly and sadly.&nbsp; I realize the dog is not ill-treated, but an important part of this guys life.</p><p>I shout: &quot;Godda love an Old Dog&quot; – He shouts back: &quot;Thanks&quot; as he leads his cherubim companion slowly back home.&nbsp; He knows the inevitable – It takes love. &nbsp;Right brain uncorks a bottle of compassion, responsibility and pathos and serves it up in my cup of life.</p><p>And Ulysses’ story.&nbsp; It will be bought cheaply: a few dollars, some honest interest in him as a human being, and a feeling that he is heard will be the price. &nbsp;It isn’t expensive, just precious. &nbsp;Godda Love an Old Dog.</p><p>All us Old Dogs need it. &nbsp;I thank my Right brain for paying attention to this and my Left brain for putting it into words, both are well loved Old Dogs to me. (High Five, right brain, I knew you could do it!)</p><p>And yes, in a sense, India DID go to Jim.&nbsp; I’ll tell you about that, too.</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
