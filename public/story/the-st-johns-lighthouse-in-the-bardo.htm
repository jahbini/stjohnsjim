Fiction, stories, real stuff, crazy stuff, St. John’s stuff. &nbsp;That’s the most fascinating: the stories from Saint John’s residents. &nbsp;All I need to do is pay attention. &nbsp;The St. John’s Lighthouse will illuminate as many stories as I can transcribe.</p><p>So here I am in St. John’s, trying to fill the bardo by writing down all the stories that I’m running into.&nbsp; The people here are fascinating, and<span class="FBname">Friend</span>, here’s one now: Gandalf is up at the counter:</p><p>Gandalf tells me: &quot;Next door to my house was an old lady in her 90’s.&nbsp; She moved a few years ago to a nursing home. &nbsp; She sold to a couple of Mother Goddess worshippers who did some renovations and put a natural irrigation system in their back yard.&nbsp; Bingo! Body! &nbsp;Seems the old lady’s husband was unfaithful too many times, and just went missing 50 years ago.</p><p>Gandalf continued: &quot;The new owners very, very quietly, did a cleansing, smudging, new agey blessing on the remains and report that the place is no longer haunted.&nbsp; The old lady is alive and happy in her rest home.&nbsp; A femur is used to stake the tomatoes.</p><p>Behind Gandalf in line, Samwise tells me about the shanghai tunnels.&nbsp; He says that they even start up here and go down to the Willamette.&nbsp; Followed the sewer tunnels mostly.&nbsp; Said there were tunnels under the Willamette. &nbsp;That’s the way it was in 1880, you go to the wrong bar, get drunk, wake up on a ship sailing to Opium City. &nbsp;</p><p>Stories. &nbsp;You can’t NOT hear the stories: the bardo of St. John’s is filled with stories, isn’t it,<span class="FBname">Friend</span>?</p><p>St. John’s still has hope of reaching the shore on the other side of the gap. &nbsp;Hope: I think it’s somehow related to the Mona Lisa of Infrastructure we have here: The incredibly beautiful<a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=images%3A+st.+johns+bridge&amp;biw=1043&amp;bih=596">St. John’s Bridge</a>: Why so Beautiful? Why here where nobody can see it? But there it is: a vision of hope and beauty. &nbsp;Isn’t the cosmic laughter pretty awesome?</p><p>I’m still in the bardo.&nbsp; Most everybody is in St. John’s. &nbsp;But my writing is getting better, at least I hope so.&nbsp;It’s the bridge. &nbsp;It gives hope that there is another shore on the other side: and until we find it, the view from the St John’s Lighthouse continues to amaze.</p><p>I remain,</p><p>– St. John’s Jim</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
