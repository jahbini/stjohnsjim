&nbsp;That’s what fortune tellers do best.</p><p>More buzz last week in St. John’s revolved around a possible suicide off the St. John’s Bridge.&nbsp; Our Beloved Bridge just got out of the Oregon Penitentiary a few years ago for assisting too many suicides.&nbsp; He had a gun and everything and was threatening babies with crystal morphine.&nbsp; At least that’s what the street buzz was all about.</p><p>A street waif came up to me on Thursday evening, hugs me and says &quot;I don’t want to NOT love you:&nbsp; I need to go now&quot; – I saw her again on Monday, she smiled, talked amiably, and the odd glint in her eye was gone.&nbsp; Maybe I’m a father figure.&nbsp; Maybe I looked like her fix kit.&nbsp; The moon was full.&nbsp; I told her that I’m not the Celarien, I just play one in real life.</p><p>I walked through Slim’s late, late on Friday.&nbsp; A very young and beautiful lady was leading around a guy built like a fullback.&nbsp; She asked about my hat and such.&nbsp; As soon as I said the word Tarot, she was all into a reading:&nbsp; She suspended her fullback in her gaze and floated us over to a waiting booth.&nbsp; Ordering the Tarot Reader his required shot of rum she shows all the signs of a Female-Lion tamer.&nbsp; Yes, you guessed it:<a href="http://www.bardagency.com/store/tarot_11_strength_detail.html">Tarot Card VIII, Strength</a>.&nbsp; The girl power card.&nbsp; Amped up on Great Harvest Steroids.</p><p>We do the reading.&nbsp; When the knight of swords comes up, and I ask her if that might be the hulk who she wore like a feather boa.&nbsp; She flashes ‘no, no, no’ in invisible sign language and we proceed.&nbsp; After the reading, (and during, and before) she is huggy and affectionate.&nbsp; Having had a bit of experience with women of Great Strength, I figure the Fullback, with his taste for spicy burgers,&nbsp; will be in for a rough life.&nbsp; Adios, Mr Lion and your future with Strength.</p><p>It all reminds me of dwarf Grumpy’s advice: &quot;Careful, She’s got Womanly Wiles!&quot;<span class="FBname">Friend</span>, I hear you ask, &quot;What are they?&quot; &nbsp;Grumpy is quick to answer: &quot;I don’t know, but I’m<em><strong>agin</strong></em><strong>‘em</strong>&quot; —Relax Grumpy, Life is far sweeter with that particular cup, just make sure you follow the house rules and always tip the bartender.</p><p>I wander home singing: &quot;It’s Strengths illusions I recall, I really don’t know Strength at all.&quot;&nbsp; I go back home and pass by the house on 3 Gunas Loop.&nbsp; All three of the wise men there seem to be howling at the moon.</p><p><span class="FBname">Friend</span>, meet me again at the James John Cafe, here at a secret location near the Willamette River and&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll let you know what I found out. &nbsp;There’s more. &nbsp;Much more.</p><p>Jim</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
