It is slowly being re-built.  Visionary, it seems, is planning a whopping art show in a few days at the North End Gallery.  He descended onto stage cool-zero with sweeping glances into the very corners of the hall.  Nothing escaped his glance and inclusion into a grand plan:  A true<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impresario">impresario</a>.  Planning what will be a great production.  I have been blessed.   Be there!</p><p>And now silence has re-entered the fortress — We may begin:</p><p>Bar Bets:  Here’s the thing about bar bets.  They are conversation starters.  You are supposed to pay for the conversation.  That’s what a bar bet is all about.  So when I went to the Palate of Plew’s Brews and saw a micro-brew with the work ‘merkin’ in the name, I knew I had struck ‘bar bet’ heaven.  A merkin is a pretty odd and disgusting thing.  I can’t think of a reason why someone would ever need a wig for pubic hair.</p><p>Me: I’ll bet that no one here knows what the word ‘merkin’ means.  Buy me a beer and I’ll tell you.</p><p>Them:  Oh, no… Let’s look it up on the internet.  There’s a hurricane a-brewin with our appetite for information.</p><p>All the cell phones come out, Great God Google downsizes Jim’s once in a lifetime bar-bet and 30 seconds later:  They all groan: “Yuch, that’s disgusting”</p><p>Now everybody in the bar is now chatting amiably about the fact that merkin refers to a wig for pubic hair.  Ha ha.  I am not sure about the wisdom of having a brew called ‘merkin’, but it gives you the opportunity to say “Gimme a firkin of merkin” which would be a cask of 72 pints of the brew.</p><p>The upshot of this?<span class="FBname">Friend</span>, if you and I met more often here, they’d have a nicer clientele.  Show me your best bar bet, OK?</p><p>I have just been handed a Late Breaking Flash!
