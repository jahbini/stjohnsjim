&nbsp;Well, Art is the Fool. &nbsp;The reason it blew apart? &nbsp;There was no King. &nbsp;The king is responsible for consequences. &nbsp;Art? &nbsp;Not so much.</p><p>Pentacles are the<strong><em>Git &lsquo;er done</em></strong>folk.&nbsp; Kings know, find and create&nbsp;<em><strong>&lsquo;er</strong></em>&nbsp; &mdash; that&rsquo;s what Kings do.&nbsp; The actual&nbsp;<em><strong>Git done</strong></em>&nbsp;part is the domain of the Knights and Pages of Pentacles. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>What are Knights and Pages?&nbsp; From a Tarot standpoint, let&rsquo;s just say that the Knights are the core workers and hands-on managers, and the Pages are sales, marketing, administration. &nbsp; The King knows the space.&nbsp; Knows it very well. &nbsp;The King owns the space. &nbsp;If the space is &nbsp;perfume, he knows perfume. &nbsp;If it’s baking, he knows baking. &nbsp;If it’s rocket science, he knows the tech, and keeps his cool during launch and knows what his people are telling him: A<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSFYc40c08">misfire</a>is worse than a no-fire.</p><p>Randy knows who supplies the best micro-brews.&nbsp; He stocks and runs his his place in the manner that he likes for the pleasant enjoyment of his customers. &nbsp;Randy or Hamid will give Throntle, our heroin hooker, the<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bums%20Rush">bums rush</a>because chalking poop words on the sidewalk hurts business.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s her.&nbsp; Neither Randy or Hamid or anyone hate Throntle, or really look down on her (well, maybe a little bit) but if she behaved (even a little bit!), she&rsquo;d be welcome.&nbsp; Like the wise say: &ldquo;Heroin isn&rsquo;t for everybody.&rdquo;</p><p>Totally Random question! :::&nbsp;What color are the Pope&rsquo;s Pyjamas?&nbsp; What he wears at night?&nbsp; Without looking it up! &nbsp;Cause that goes<a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=the+popes+pajamas&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">nowhere</a>! &nbsp;(dont bother clicking that link. &nbsp;it really wont tell you.) &nbsp;Popes make few practical decisions.</p><p>Kings make practical decisions.&nbsp; If you sit down with Hamid and ask &ldquo;why did you make such-and-such a decision&rdquo; &mdash; and he can sit down and explain in simple terms that even a newbie dishwasher can understand.</p><p>Hamid, too. &nbsp;When I try to convince him that &quot;<a href="http://wermtea.com">Werm Tea</a>&quot; is the PERFECT name for a hot winter signature drink, Hamid thinks seriously and takes his time. &nbsp;More to figure out how to reel me in to sanity and not to make an actual decision.</p><p>Theo knows construction, and his ability to make problem solving decisions on 3 different jobs at one time is amazing.&nbsp; He just says Jesus does it. &nbsp;I think Jesus Connection is there, too. &nbsp;But if you ask him about a decision?&nbsp; Get him to slow down?&nbsp; Yes, he too, can explain in simple terms why and how a choice was made. &nbsp;Same thing with Suzanne&rsquo;s cafe.&nbsp; Practical.&nbsp; Goal directed.&nbsp; Knowledgeable.&nbsp; Aware.&nbsp; Effective.</p><p>When a king has not got that ability to relate to his Tarot Queen (The business itself &mdash; Just think that the king is married to the kingdom), the Knights, (the workers) and the Pages (eyes and ears), the kingdom does not thrive, and dwindles.&nbsp; Dumas had great fun commenting on the French Royalty&rsquo;s difficult history.&nbsp; But Louis the 16th wasn&rsquo;t the only king to lose touch with the essentials of his job.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSFYc40c08">A misfire is worse than a no-fire.</a></p><p>A Knight or Page can become a king when the child grows up, to claim and defend the kingdom and husband it&rsquo;s prosperity.&nbsp; Kings are mature, and comfortable with being Practical, Goal Directed, Knowledgeable, Aware and Effective.&nbsp; Because business is business.</p><p>But when one of those essential elements is missing: being Aware, Knowledgeable.&nbsp; Not recognizing practicality. You name it. Then it&rsquo;s French Revolution time, or &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=Lord+save+us+from+the+wrath+of+the+Viking&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Lord save us from the wrath of the Vikings</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=bankruptcy+rise&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">there isn&rsquo;t much call for buggy-whips anymore</a>&rdquo;</p><p>When it comes to business, it takes a king to make king sized decisions with king sized consequences: a King of Pentacles. &nbsp;You now have an idea of what a King must do and why.</p><p>What do you want on your Tombstone? &nbsp;Put this one on mine: &quot;He had a pleasant thought as he went into the light&quot; – and he &quot;never accepted money from amoebas!&quot;</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
