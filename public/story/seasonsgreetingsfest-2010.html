And the red cape,<span class="FBname">Friend</span>, popped a few eyes. Elegance now comes in Thai-hot.</p><p>Even in Tommy, OR the fun is Thai hot. It seems SeasonsGreetingsFest 2010 involves lots of calls at 2 and 3 AM.</p><p>&ldquo;NO! She&rsquo;s a Wack Job. No, she isn&rsquo;t here. &hellip; No, a Wack Job, a WACK JOB. I don&rsquo;t take her calls anymore. Tell her to stop texting me.&rdquo; and &ldquo;What bar are you at? You weren&rsquo;t supposed to be out of Jail until Thursday. She said that? You better be gone by the time I get there.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course Tommy never really went to the bar, that&rsquo;s not his style. He is a master of keeping the drama going even while he spins the chnnel selector on the TV. &nbsp;He multi-tasks.</p><p>I have recently commissioned a logo &mdash; my stuff is notoriously deficient in graphics. When I looked at it, it had all the right elements, the artist was faithful to my intent, but&hellip;</p><p>Tommy usually has one or two of these triangles going. For&nbsp;SeasonsGreetingFest 2010&nbsp;he is spinning these things like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhoos1oY404">plate guy</a>&nbsp;on Ed Sullivan. Tommy&rsquo;s only rule is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fish off the company pier&rdquo; &mdash; Any other pier? Go for it!&nbsp;Tommy is feeling the merry making Spirit of the Season.</p><p>Tommy’s rule: Just make sure it is at least 10% true otherwise his conscience bothers him. &nbsp;</p><p>Actually Tommy&rsquo;s conscience does not ever really bother him. He may not win every battle, and is sometimes the one to come out with a bruise or two, but he can not imagine a world where this kind of competition and pettiness does not exist. &nbsp;He is who he is, in the world he sees.</p><p>And since it is the season of giving, Tommy wants to share his true feelings with everyone: misery. Tommy says: &quot;If it’s at&nbsp;least 10% true, try it and fly it&quot;.</p><p>In the logo I look like Casper – ghostly. 0xfff in HTML slang. Pallid to the point of potash. Life-drained. I was not sure at first, so Southwick did a time-displaced mind meld at the meme level by bouncing sub-molecular vibrations off of objects in space.</p><p>The e-mail reply from the cat-goddess was: &nbsp;&quot;Nailed It!&quot; &nbsp;– Accurate feedback is to be rewarded. To both artist and feline-fatale I bid you refresh yourself with a bubble bath and a cigar. Thank you. Your&nbsp;consciences remain clean.</p><p>Roger&rsquo;s conscience, on the other hand, will improve as he laboriously untangles himself from Tommy&rsquo;s innuendos. Tommy started rumors that Roger got out the snow shovel so that Tommy&rsquo;s old fiance could steal it. We wish Roger a grand holiday and quiet future in his new home on the charismatic Oregon Coast. Roger&rsquo;s true feelings: weariness. Roger says: &ldquo;Ya think?&rdquo;</p><p>Southwick&rsquo;s conscience is pretty good. Willful acts of moon are not willful acts of evil. Southwick&rsquo;s true feelings: myopic optimism. Southwick says: &ldquo;Who said the dick was the first to go?&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s High Noon and I&rsquo;m declaring war on pallid. &nbsp;OK, pallid, I&rsquo;m growing a beard.</p><p>St. John’s Christmas tree trimming saw non-pallid crowd pleaser, Orion Guimond, organize a children’s Christmas tree trimming under the Mayor’s watchful eye. &nbsp;Both the Mayor and Orion’s children’s army enjoyed the moment. &nbsp;The first week of SeasonsGreetingsFest 2010 went very well in St. John’s.</p><p>St. John’s merchant’s true feelings: optimistic.</p><hr /><p>The first signs of my beard is that it is completely white. Now I&rsquo;ll be casper the fuzzy ghost. Crap.</p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kingsporch.jpg">tattoo on a beard</a>. Yeah. Sure.</p><p>How&rsquo;s that to give you Myopia of the Optimism?</p><hr /></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
