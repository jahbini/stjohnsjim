Did he not tell you to say that? Is the queen blameless?&rdquo;</p><p>Even in his pain, the prisoner knows where his true allegiance lies: &ldquo;Yes, she is blameless: Lord Vaso forced me.&rdquo; &mdash; A glance from the Monk and the prisoner is forever silent.</p><p>(Tommy says: &quot;Bingo, the trap is sprung! &nbsp;Hot Damn.&quot; &nbsp;Southwick replies: &quot;Yes, just like we saw on the Childrens Trauma Workshop on TV&quot;)</p><p>Lord Vaso is shocked at the turn, and&nbsp;without his witness, is powerless.</p><p>The Monk looks across to Lord Vaso: &ldquo;You would torture children to get servants to lie, so you can start your war with the Queen&rsquo;s home. This whole family is now wholly dependent on the queen, in addition to replacing her servant.&nbsp; The blood of this man&rsquo;s family is now on your hands.&rdquo;</p><p>The Monk suggests that Lord Vaso forfeit an eighth of his estate so the queen may take care of her new adopted family. &nbsp;Lord Vaso looks hard at the Monk.</p><p>As the party walks back from the guardhouse, the Monk says: &ldquo;Prosperity demands stability.&nbsp; Do you not agree that stability is better than war?&rdquo;&nbsp; The King and Queen agree,&rdquo;you are truly wise.&rdquo; &nbsp; The Monk says: &ldquo;It is a good thing to find any path to stability during times of chaos.&nbsp; I may not always be so wise as this night.&nbsp; I will endeavor to help Lord Vaso learn the value of stability&rdquo;</p><p>(Southwick finishes: &quot;We wanted to keep Lord Vaso’s and the Queen’s real involvement secret, because it really does not make any difference if stability is preserved. &nbsp;And that part of the ending was Tommy’s idea – It keeps the option open to have a sequel&quot; &nbsp;Tommy replies: &quot;Yeah, Am I Smart or what? And next time come up with something better than _’you are truly wise’ –_That’s just lame&quot; )</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">© 2016 James A.
