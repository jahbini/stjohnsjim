Even when I mentioned that getting a modern printer to work with these old machines was met with the response:&nbsp; There are plenty of free printers at the Church.</p><p>Last week Jug was pretty unhappy.&nbsp; The recipes are piling up.&nbsp; Dammit Jim, I want these recipes.&nbsp; Will you help me get DBase II working or not? &nbsp; I replied that I&rsquo;m happy to provide as much or as little help as Jug needs.&nbsp; A hobby is a hobby.</p><p>But last week I asked Jug what was important here. &nbsp;Was it to get his recipes on-line? Or were old-time computers the hobby?&nbsp; Was his mission to Free the DBase Two at the end of chapter 21 the big goal? Jug is at chapter 6 now: one chapter a month is pretty good for an old beast like this, but it&rsquo;s really bad if he wants recipes.&nbsp; He replied that he was able to do it inexpensively because the program was FREE, and the one on the internet was complicated and cost $50.</p><p>And then I asked him to add up his time and he said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Right.&nbsp;<strong><em>Money!</em></strong>&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; and then a strange thing happened.&nbsp; Jug stopped for a moment and said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it.&nbsp; Even if I forget the money, I want it to WORK! My way.&rdquo;</p><p>I said:&nbsp; &ldquo;Thats OK.&nbsp; You get to pick your goal and I&rsquo;m happy to help, but you don&rsquo;t seem to be enjoying this.&nbsp; If the payoff from this is only a working recipe program and the expense is your enjoyment of your life, that may not be the balance you want.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like trying to get a small advantage in traffic and getting all steamed up at the loss of some tiny ego-centered goal.&nbsp; It is better to pick goals that give a bigger payoff with less hassle.&nbsp; Work up to more complicated slowly.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, Jug said &ldquo;Fuck the DBase Two.&nbsp; Let them rot in their prison.&rdquo;</p><p>Today I saw Jug on the street:&nbsp; I said &ldquo;Hi Jug, Howzit!&rdquo;</p><p>He said: &ldquo;See, I got a Jug!&nbsp; By the way, I&rsquo;m using that recipe program from the internet. Works fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Every time I see him he says &ldquo;got a jug&rdquo; or &ldquo;see, no jug&rdquo; &mdash; He explains that is how he keeps his<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggernaut">Jug-or-Not</a>nickname.&nbsp; I agree, being in control of the nicknames people have for you is a good thing, Yes?.</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><aside id="sidebar" class="hidden-print col-3"></aside></div></div><div id="footer" class="row"><div class="outer"><div id="footer-info" class="inner">Â© 2016 James A.
