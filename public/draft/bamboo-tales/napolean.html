Tommy was there, too.</p><p>Tommy had a minion that would ride in the back of the pickup truck and snag a goat from a nearby truck.  sometimes when the trucks were moving, too.</p><p>They were only caught once when the minion Southwick, who at that time was on his “anti-cock-block” campaign.  Well, it was when Southwick didn’t dispatch the goat quickly enough:  The goat bawling while Southwick chanted the names of kung-fu deities and fumbling with the Makita Drill.</p><p>Tommy gunned it, and sped across the St. John’s Bridge.  His pursuer didn’t make the turn at the end fast enough and crashed into the hillside.</p><p>After that Southwick had to take remedial training in goat garroting by a garrison of goatairian garroteers.  Southwick left Portland rather than take this fateful step.</p><p>Southwick now prefers to channel the spirits of small insects.  From the ectopian beyond, that is.  You know, where no mind should go, but it’s OK.  At least there is a clean ending.  Not crappy, like the ending of “Glitch”</p><p>It seems that Bonita, remember her? Yes, The Bonita, was telling Napolean of the suffering of the vermiculites and the stalagmites.</p><p>All the while pops and poops saw and heard it all as they snacked on the bookcase.  It was bamboo, and handcrafted, lightweight, sturdy and fashionable in the society of the day.</p><p>Pops scraped off another bit of bamboo and passed it to Poops.</p><div class="bg-lighten-3 media border mb-2"><div class="media-body col-8 col-sm-10"><h5>Msg from: <span class="h6">Pops</span></h5><p>Here, have a bite of this: there is extra flavor in this section of bamboo.

The stalagmites always grow back, so don’t think this will go away.  Umm, I’m suddenly hungry, I’m going to scrape some bamboo</p></div></div><div class="bg-lighten-3 media border mb-2"><div class="media-body col-8 col-sm-10"><h5>Msg from: <span class="h6">Poops</span></h5><p>Don’t forget to take little Chu and Cha with you, they can’t scrape a tunnel like you yet.  And they have stopped talking.  I guess the stalagmites are going to the gulag.  And now they are just going to make the humidity rise.  I hate that, it makes my eggs swell.</p></div></div><p>Poops and pops lived a long and easy life in that bamboo bookcase until it fell apart and was put out on the street.</p><p>As for Chu and Cha, they grew up and flew to the docks at the river and found a treasure of a lifetime: A whole shipment of Bamboo Chairs, Daybeds, Desks and Bookcases bound for places all over the world.</p><p>A voice: So am I now Cha or Poops?  Poops Cha?
