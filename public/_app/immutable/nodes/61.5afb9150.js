She sewed her own costume this year as every year. Last year she dressed up as as Carmen Miranda with a tutti-frutti hat. This year she decided to be a sunflower with glowing golden petals surround her face. She figured that sewing little lights to the back of each petal would help light the way.",i,m="Instead, she is nearly blinded by the lights around her face and the children are holding her hands to keep her from bumping the telephone poles.",d,J="That was the cause of her leading the kids off the planned route and finding herself on 3 Gunas Lp by Pier Park. The children run up to the door and knock.",f,M="“Trick or Treat!” Tommy opens the door. He has nothing. He considers slamming the door, but instead says “wait a minute.” He grabs a handful of stuff from the bathroom shelves and jams them into the waiting goodie baskets, saying “Be safe kids.”",y,W="Pathy sighs and turns: “Follow me children. Hold hands.” She starts out to the next house, but loses her bearings almost immediately and walks straight into the darkest part of Pier Park.",c,R="Pathy stops at a bench and gives the kids a moment to rest.

Another had mouthwash. There were a couple of condoms in there too. A small silk bag with red jellied candy.

I bet there is a raccoon over there. Don’t scare it.” She turns off her lighted costume and gazes into the darkness. “Did you see that? It ran right by us!”",k,E="The raccoon wanders in between the cedars, and then seems to climb straight up into the air. One of the children screams: “It’s a spider!” Pathy looks carefully and gulps: “Oh, no, it’s just a trick of the light. Let’s head back to the street!” Secretly she is scared stiff, but keeps her cool and gets the kids back to Tommy’s house.",w,F="She knocks: “Southwick. Are you there? I need your help.” Tommy answers. “Hey, aren’t you one of Southwick’s friends? I’ll go get him. How’d you like the Halloween treats?

It had eight legs! It dropped this.” She shows him a small bag full of squares of red jelly candy.

Station and Leo sell it over the internet for their sex wrestling seminars.”",b,Y="Southwick looks at the bag. It’s a silk bag with the initials T.Q.

And you need a partner, you know.” Southwick looks into Pathy’s eyes.

Tommy?!!”",q,nt="Southwick: “I’ve seen Steven and Bambi Brew over at the place a couple of times since July. Tommy has some crazy idea about toxic DNA recycling. Way over my head.
