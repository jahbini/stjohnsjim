It is a fabulous workout: I’ve lost 30 pounds and finally have abs. It is heavy into Eastern Mystic Tradition, but totally focussed on hand to anything combat. Grab me by the hair? Arm Lock? Head Lock? Full Nelson? Knife? Gun? There is a move for all that. All the moves end in hospital visits for the attacker. Can I do them? No. Heck, I can’t even master “falling down” or it’s more challenging vertical variant: “Standing Up”. But<em>they</em>can. Proof? Remember the Philippine-American war? Our troops in the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_martial_arts">Philippines</a>? The hand-to-hand fighting was so intense that we resorted to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cure_(torture)#Philippine-American_War">extreme methods</a>(ugh! Teddy Roosevelt, say it ain’t so! ) and invented a bigger<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol#Early_history_and_adoption">gun</a>to stop these 120 pound fighters who were armed only with sticks and yo-yos.
