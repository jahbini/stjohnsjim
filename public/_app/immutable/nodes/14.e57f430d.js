She talked about "Walta," pronouncing the W almost as if it were a V. She never called him Liberace: Her term of affection for him was "Walta-Vault" "Walta was a real strong man, his arms and chest were like a bank safe. He was my vault. I could tell him anything, and he would protect it: keep it secret, you know." She told me that He and Anna became lovers and that posed a huge problem for Liberace.',g,k='Now we all have heard about Liberace’s supposed homosexuality. It was a rumor which Liberace publicly denied: "I’m not homosexual, but I am still looking for the right woman." Was he homosexual??? The fact is that this question inflamed and energized the fanbase greatly! Even straight guys would watch his show just out of morbid curiosity. It was a key ingredient in his commercial success: If the public thought he was straight, his popularity would plummet. He was a hostage to his stage persona! Secretly he and Anna had been lovers, but they had to go to incredible lengths to avoid even the hint of sexual contact.',w,M="Liberace got Anna a booking in Las Vegas at the top of the old Domino Crest casino and she became the most sought after impersonator for the late Monroe in Las Vegas. Still, the fan base for Marilyn Monroe had dwindled greatly, and her audience was mostly men. She lives there still. Her looks faded years ago, and who wants to see a saggy Marilyn? She is still part owner of some of Liberace’s real estate investments, which are still incredibly productive farm-land properties that are leased to Con-Agra. These investments see her through these final years.",y,P="As I departed, I asked Anna about the real Monroe’s affair with JFK.
