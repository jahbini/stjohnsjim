There is a plaque there dedicated to Tommy: "He so loved The Truth, he invented new ways to have sex with it." I think Alfred P. Doolittle had morals to match.',t,f="A little while later I saw a familiar street person. Lola of the incredible smile. Lola is about 75 years old. She is a street person: stroke person. No real retirement benefits or huge divorce settlement. Down and Out, it seems. Always at the bars, always on the sidewalk. She is totally at the mercy of whoever might help her.",d,C='She moves stiffly, but that only shows how much she has battled against her stroke.

It’s a wand to create magic. Gaze at your peril. No, not your peril; Gaze at your benefit. But her gift of emotional expression is near the end of it’s ride. What now? I don’t think Lola looks at life that way. She is always ready with a smile that uplifts.",y,L="What is it that makes Lola so positive? Is it desperation? No, I see lot’s of desperation on the streets. Lola is not desperate. Lola is expectant. Expectant that life provides wonder and challenge and change.",w,I="Right now, Lola will likely head in the direction of all our street folk. Down. More desperate.
