Shreck.  The St. John’s theatre has children’s matinee’s each weekend; the kind of entertainment I remember as a kid.  A few ads for junk food, maybe some paper airplanes, maybe some popcorn in the air, and then some seriously silly fun up on the screen.  These kids aren’t yet into networks or jackasses, families have enough to deal with as the blessed baby-asses they are still.",d,I='As a true ingesticative journalist, I needed to try out the "chicken bread pudding" from the James John Cafe.  More souffle than pudding, this flavor grenade has a mix of textures to keep my tongue happy for

I didn’t think I’d get any further information from Bambi: he spoke through tight lips, and I figured there was more to this.",g,P='I talked to the owner of the Cup of Blarn — “Thumper” Olsen has the

Business.  So we been talkin’ with the Ethics Department at Waterfront University.  Pretty soon Bambi won’t be so important around here.”  Ethics?  Waterfront U?  I think I’ll need to talk to
