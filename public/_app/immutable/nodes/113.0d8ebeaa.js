Raised mostly in New Jersey, but somehow brought out to Portland by Geppetto, who sold his woodcarving business and bought quite a LOT of land here. High priced industrial land. Or, at least that’s the fog that Tommy puts out. Blustery about even very small things out of place. Snores like a razorback in rut.

Losing Wanda hit him hard: he wanted to be the stallion that could tame a 21 year old.

He’s murmuring “tell her to go away, I’ll call the cops.” She pounds away for another 15 minutes. She walks away shouting threats that would freeze the heart of Capn Ahab.<br/>This morning, Tommy leaves early, putting up a note to Roger saying: “Call me ASAP” – Agitated Roger is cooking his breakfast, and turns to Southwick: “Is it OK to VENT?” – He says “Sure.” (Southwick knows I’m a sucker for an interesting story, and this one is devine! )",H,Q='<p>It seems that Tommy snooped around on FaceList or CraigBook or somewhat and found an ad for a request for a threesome from Wanda and her new boyfriend, Carl.
