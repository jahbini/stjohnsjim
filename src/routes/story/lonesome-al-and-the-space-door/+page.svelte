          | , as I’m sitting in the James John Cafe this afternoon, I notice a twenty something wearing sweatpants, a hoodie, and a huge feather headdress from a Los Vegas show. It’s sea green with shimmering blue sparklies. The ceiling fan makes the feathers swirl around like a dancing shiva and the colored sparklies play fairy games on the walls.  Actually, I wouldn’t really notice, except she pronounces the state as

        p Graphic — All of the above graphics are small, postage stamp size in the background of this frame. In the foreground is Lonesome Al. He is alone in a largish room. It is like a combo living-dining desk area. He is playing an internet game.
        p Lonesome Al: We’ve all seen those images thousands of times. The success of our colonies is fabulous, isn’t it. But what these families are always surprised about is that you can not get back. It’s a one-way trip.
        p These doors can transport anything and everything except themselves. It’s the mini-black hole power supplies. Precious few mini-black holes on the other side of these doors. If you can’t find the 10,000 or so of these to power a second door, well, you are just stuck.

          | Graphic — Lonesome Al is space-walking outside his deep space facility. It seems much as a working-family cottage, but made of pre-fab parts. The same golden glow surrounds Al as well as the cottage.
        p Lonesome Al: yup: this is it. This is my home. There are just no way to get a back connection, so I’m stuck here. My wife and I decided it was best that she stay back on Earth with the kids. We still talk. Quantum General treats me pretty well. They send pretty much anything that I really need. I got my own facebook page and lots of fans, so I’m still connected. Kinda.
        p Caption: Ladies! I’m set for life. Come join me in my castle in space. Serious inquiries only.

          br
          | Lonesome Al invented Space Yoga, and became the only living master. He “allowed” only the most devoted of the practitioners to join him in space. He is now surrounded by fanatical yoginis who are now asking for a couple more Tarot decks and more of Roger’s Space Caulk. They are far too lofty minded to help Al with that shipment Tommy sent. Too bad Al didn’t invent Space Tantra.
