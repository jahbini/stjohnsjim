          | . I have finally broken through a culture wall in Oregon! There are several sub-cultures that co-exist in St. John’s, and I want to speak to, and speak about all of St. John’s culture groups. You know, it’s that bridge thing. I would love to add St. John’s large latino population, but alas, I speak little spanish, and even less mariachi.

        p You see, this very day, I woke up to runners in the street. I don’t drive, so it doesn’t bother me, but they had about a half mile fronting Pier Park roped off. A Half Jogette. The Police attended the final moments of the race: the finish was signaled by flashing lights as the cops picked up the cones blocking the street, instead of cheers at the finish line.
        p The St. John’s definition of “Half Joggette” seems to have been Half Prepared — no permit.
        p I can imagine the last meeting called by ToadStoolPixie and StoolSecretary Pic and Zee: We arrive in the middle of the ring of mushrooms as soto and voce are texting in front of us.
