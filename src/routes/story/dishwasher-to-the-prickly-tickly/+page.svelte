        p Veterans Day, 2010:  Mark your calendars — this is the day the Portland starts wearing longjohns 24/7 — Whizzing has just gotten astronomically more difficult.
        p Veterans Day, a holiday.  I celebrate with a walk over to Pier Park to enjoy a sweet steam breath PNW morning.  The big evergreens are having discussions high above: you don’t think they talk to each other with their trunks do you?  No, Their lofty discussions are echoed in bird calls and rustling branches. They keep their discussions on a high level.

        p Down on the ground some of the playground stuff puzzles me: are these bowls for puking after spinning in the swings?  Some sort of high tech tin-can telephone?  Some sort of chair?
        p Take your babies to the park.  Maybe they can figure out those wierd cuppy things.  I won’t, it’s too much fun letting my imagination run wild.
        p But as I walk through the neighborhoods, I see the threadbare trees with prickly tickly tops.  And my thoughts shift to the babies of the Kings.
        p We all have babies of one sort or another.  They all require care to grow strong and worthy.  Real babies, yes, but also your goals, enterprises and dreams.  Even Throntle has the dream of getting off the needle.  At present, it’s a miscarriage, but we can always hope.
        p Bringing a dream to life in November is hard: not like Thanksgiving day.  It’s more like the prickly tickly events and reactions we share with the prickly tickly trees.

        p Some shops are truly babies, showing lots of growing pains instead of giggles and smiles.  How can I tell?  Here’s my secret: I wash dishes.
        p Like Southwick, my first job was dishwasher in a chinese restaurant.  As long as people prefer to eat off of ceramic, it will be a hard job to outsource.

        p Southwick also tells me that when he visits friends he will often volunteer as dishwasher.  He gets into a flow.  Turns on his worker energy.  It’s humble, but your hands are always getting clean and warm.  That’s important on a PNW evening at a friend’s place.

          | There is a bit of fun for the careful observer, too.  From simple stuff like “Hmm. people aren’t eating the horse hoof salad tonight” to “Hmmm. ‘Suzy heart Joe’ finger painted in gravy.”  After a while the hints can build up and you know that

        p So when the personal interactions seem like the Gulf Oil Spill of emotions, a cleaning is in order. While we are not exactly washing ceramic plates, you get the idea. Kind of like cleaning a horse. Start at the top.  Work down.

        p With people on a team, you simply start at the top with the highest commonly shared Thanksgiving goals of the team.  Things they all agree about.  Then you work down to details carefully and slowly honoring all participants.

          | It works best when the emotions are clean and clear, but you do what you can.  Cloudy emotions are not bad, just inefficient as they make our vision of goals and roles less clear and less obtainable.  If you want to obtain success, you may want to take out the mental trash.  It’s not just for

        p It’s like washing dishes.  Some of it cleans up easily, and some of it requires a bit of time to soak before you get to the squeaky clean of better judgement.  And, like a shower, you may want to do it more than once.
