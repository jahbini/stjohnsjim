        p One of my best dumpster diving correspondents on the street has gone missing.  No one has seen Ulysses for about a month, and I am wondering if he is one of those fabled “Snow Rummys,”  You know, bums who can go south for the winter and north for the summer.   He was pretty active, and always had his hand out, along with the same well recited lines.

        p Power Begging and the 4 Hour Begging Week System
        p Hi, this is Ulysses,  I’ve been on the streets for 15 years.  Homeless.  Inner city.  This is the life style that takes you down quick.  Begging, rejection, religion, all bad news.  Few can make it as long as two years.  But I figured out a way to survive on the streets that don’t take you down.  All without compromising your lifestyle - alcohol? no problem.  drugs? no problem.  No attention span? Perfect.

          | said after I taught him Power Begging:  “I kiss the gutter each night and thank you Ulysses for your mostly guaranteed income tricks that keep me down and out — All in only 4 hours of begging a week.  Thank You for your life altering “Power Begging” techniques and your mind-blowing 4 hour Begging Week.
        p The 4 hour Begging Week is so simple that this guy can do it.  And it’s hardly ever illegal.  You can be homeless where ever you want.  Inner City in the Summer?  Arizona Desert in the Winter?
        p What’s the biggest problem with begging?  It’s boring, humiliating, full of rejection and tedious to remember what story you told last time.
        p But with the 4 Hour Begging Week, we lay it out for you in terms a wino can understand, and you can live on the street like the bum you really are!

          | , If
          em you
          |  look online you will come up with nothing, of course.  For Ulysses,  sleeping with the mermaids of the Willamette is as likely as where "there’s a lake of stew and whiskey too, at the big rock candy mountain." – Although, if he comes back in April and wants to sell me his franchise, I just might buy it!
        p Tarot Note:  The reading today came from the randomly drawn destination "Strength" with the motif cards: 2 of Wands (getting the word out) and the seven of swords (the trickster).    Honest.
