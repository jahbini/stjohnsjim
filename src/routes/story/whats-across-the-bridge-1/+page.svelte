        p Last night, the Oregon rain reached the millisecond 100% saturation point: Everything instantly wet, through and through. Even my backpack. That’s pretty amazing.
        p As I lay my tarot out to dry on the pool table of my cathedral of solitude under the Art Gallery, I hit upon this incredible scheme to wake the Muse. Shuffle and pick three cards: A destination, and two motif cards. The destination is “across the bridge” and the two motif cards are what might happen.
