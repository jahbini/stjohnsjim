        p  I have held off ordering the Pork Chops, Grits and Eggs at the James John Cafe for about five or six days.  Friends:  This is the combination of tastes, aromas and textures that turns your mouth into a concert hall.  I, St. John’s Jim have so declared.

        p You see I have had the ex-california shock-jock reply to my last story with the phrase "put the Blood of the Lamb in my Throat" – My visits to spirituality have been abundant, and I’m pretty familiar with the "blood of the lamb" part, but I’m puzzled by the "Throat" part.  Clearly it has Biblical Proportions, and my mission on earth as Old Testament Prophet may be finally paying off.
        p Here is my problem:  Is it a blessing or a curse?  "Watch out or I’ll put the blood of the lamb in your throat" or worse: "I’ll deep throat you with the Blood of the Lamb" – I’d add that to my "Lion’s Roar" arsenal.
