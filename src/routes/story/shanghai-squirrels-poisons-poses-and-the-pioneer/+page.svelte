        p I want a squirrel tail for my hat.  Southwick is taking me on a tour of back-woods St. John’s, deep into Tommy County to find out what uses they have found for a permanent Pacific Northwest resource: the common squirrel.  The residents there say the county line is 50 feet around the nearest cop.
        p Southwick tells me that Ella used to work at Waterfront U.  There was a scandal about embezzling that Ella got caught up in, and that Tommy was instrumental in keeping Ella out of jail.
        p Ella has small house near a wildlife preserve.  Ella laughs a lot. Weird laugh. She is small and shriveled. It looks like a life of cigarette smoke has sucked her vital essences and replaced them with creosote. She could be 75, she could be 45. Impossible to tell. There is a bench and vials of odd chemicals, tools and jigs for carving, shaping and mounting.
        p
          | Ella has a notebook of photos of her work. The squirrels are in many poses.  There is a "moments from history" section -  Washington Crossing the Delaware, Lincoln’s assasination, raising the flag at Iwo Jima, the

          | . Serious stuff.  Most, though, are riding in cars or on motorcycles. A few are in Kama Sutra positions. 
        p She talks taxidermy: “I still use the old formulas. It’s hard to get arsenic and mercury any more, but Tommy can get anything. Toxic Tommy!” She picks up a syringe and starts poking it into her work. She cackles. She starts to wheeze.
        p I ask her about the old formulas: "Arsenic and mercury are really nasty poisons that keep on killing, how can you use them so close to the nature preserve?"
        p Ella replies: "Where do you think Tommy gets the stuff from?  This is the Willamette!  He hauls out a ton, and I put back in a pound.  It’s cap and trade, baby.  It’s sustainable." 
        p Southwick pulls the package from Tommy. Ella opens it: a group of squirrels enjoying Da Vinci’s ‘last supper.’
        p She reads the note: “Tommy says it’s too high-brow to have them on chairs. He thinks he can sell it if I put the squirrels on motorcycles. Tommy’s been real good to me, what a great guy. He really helped me after that awful business over at Waterfront U.”
        p She asks me if I want anything, and I ask the price of a squirrel’s tail.
        p She replies: “No, I only sell the whole pelt.  I got a reputation, you know. I tell you what I can do, is to mount one on the front of your brim. I do good work.” She points to one with squid tentacles where its head should be.”
        p Me: “Nice work. I’ll pass on a hat mounted stuffed squirrel. I just want the tail for a hat-band.”
        p Ella: “Nope, not much call for a squirrel without a tail.  I got a reputation.  The whole thing or nothing.” She starts cackling and wheezing repeating: “a squirrel without a tail!” and “the WHOLE thing” over and over like it is some sort of in-joke. Mercury in the brain, I guess. She starts to wheeze then straightens up, and asks me: "Would ya fight for one?  You can get into the ring."
        p I’m confused: "Fight? Who? What?"
        p Southwick gets one of those "I’m gonna tell your mommie" looks on his face and says "Oh, no, Animal Fights? That’s horrible".
        p She looks me in the eye.  She says: "This is why we don’t like outsiders.  We don’t talk about things to outsiders – Are YOU an outsider?"
        p I notice the syringe needle in her hand and I put my voice into ‘soothe the beast’ mode and walk slowly backward: "Uhh.  No.  I’m totally OK.  Southwick is cool, you know him.  He’s my good buddy."  
        p She goes on: "Tommy says Southwick can’t do any harm, so he’s OK."  She explains: "You can fight any animal you want in Pioneer’s Pit. We have it on the last thursday of the month.  Man against Nature.  No guns allowed."
        p I’m a bit stunned.  "Pioneer’s Pit? No guns? How does that work?"
        p She goes on: "You get five minutes in the pit.  Squirrel, nutria, raccoon – your pick. Max points going into the pit barehanded.  When I’m judging, I give extra points for skin exposure."  She winks at me.
        p I reply, "What kind of match is it?"
        p She starts to rant: "Pioneer! That’s what men were like in the old days.  Fighting the wilds of nature: Man to Grizzly. With only a knife.  That’s not sustainable.  We just don’t have enough grizzleys to go around, and most of the men today are such wimps that they couldn’t take on a pack of wolves let alone a puma.  We gotta get back to that good pioneer spirit.  The city-fied geeks over in Intel-town are lining up to get their scars with squirrels. It’s gentrification! It’s sustainable."  She has a fury in her that would last about 10 minutes for any audience.  Just long enough to get consensus.
        p
          | "Think you can take on a raccoon?  I tell you what.  Nutrias are the easiest. You go in with this syringe, I guarantee it.  You win the fight, I’ll give you a big discount on mounting it on your hat." She shows me the squid-head thing again.  She looks me up and down and says: "Like I said – I give extra points for skin exposure.  You go in completely bare, and I’ll give you an
          em extra
          | special discount. On mounting."
        p I thank Ella for her time, explaining that I’m scheduled for heart surgery on the last Thursday of every month.  For many months.  We leave.
        p Southwick tells me he needs to make one more stop with his case of frozen squirrel.
